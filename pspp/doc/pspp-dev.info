1 Introduction
**************

This manual is a guide to PSPP internals.  Its intended audience is
developers who wish to modify or extend PSPP's capabilities.  The use of
PSPP is documented in a separate manual.  *Note Introduction: (pspp)Top.

   This manual is both a tutorial and a reference manual for PSPP
developers.  It is ultimately intended to cover everything that
developers who wish to implement new PSPP statistical procedures and
other commands should know.  It is currently incomplete, partly because
existing developers have not yet spent enough time on writing, and
partly because the interfaces not yet documented are not yet mature
enough to making documenting them worthwhile.

   PSPP developers should have some familiarity with the basics of PSPP
from a user's perspective.  This manual attempts to refer to the PSPP
user manual's descriptions of concepts that PSPP users should find
familiar at the time of their first reference.  However, it is probably
a good idea to at least skim the PSPP manual before reading this one, if
you are not already familiar with PSPP.

2.1 Values
==========

The unit of data in PSPP is a "value".

   Values are classified by "type" and "width".  The type of a value is
either "numeric" or "string" (sometimes called alphanumeric).  The width
of a string value ranges from 1 to 'MAX_STRING' bytes.  The width of a
numeric value is artificially defined to be 0; thus, the type of a value
can be inferred from its width.

   Some support is provided for working with value types and widths, in
'data/val-type.h':

 -- Macro: int MAX_STRING
     Maximum width of a string value, in bytes, currently 32,767.

 -- Function: bool val_type_is_valid (enum val_type VAL_TYPE)
     Returns true if VAL_TYPE is a valid value type, that is, either
     'VAL_NUMERIC' or 'VAL_STRING'.  Useful for assertions.

 -- Function: enum val_type val_type_from_width (int WIDTH)
     Returns 'VAL_NUMERIC' if WIDTH is 0 and thus represents the width
     of a numeric value, otherwise 'VAL_STRING' to indicate that WIDTH
     is the width of a string value.

   The following subsections describe how values of each type are
represented.

* Menu:

* Numeric Values::
* String Values::
* Runtime Typed Values::


File: pspp-dev.info,  Node: Numeric Values,  Next: String Values,  Up: Values

2.1.1 Numeric Values
--------------------

A value known to be numeric at compile time is represented as a
'double'.  PSPP provides three values of 'double' for special purposes,
defined in 'data/val-type.h':

 -- Macro: double SYSMIS
     The "system-missing value", used to represent a datum whose true
     value is unknown, such as a survey question that was not answered
     by the respondent, or undefined, such as the result of division by
     zero.  PSPP propagates the system-missing value through
     calculations and compensates for missing values in statistical
     analyses.  *Note (pspp)Missing Observations::, for a PSPP user's
     view of missing values.

     PSPP currently defines 'SYSMIS' as '-DBL_MAX', that is, the
     greatest finite negative value of 'double'.  It is best not to
     depend on this definition, because PSPP may transition to using an
     IEEE NaN (not a number) instead at some point in the future.

 -- Macro: double LOWEST
 -- Macro: double HIGHEST
     The greatest finite negative (except for 'SYSMIS') and positive
     values of 'double', respectively.  These values do not ordinarily
     appear in user data files.  Instead, they are used to implement
     endpoints of open-ended ranges that are occasionally permitted in
     PSPP syntax, e.g. '5 THRU HI' as a range of missing values (*note
     (pspp)MISSING VALUES::).


File: pspp-dev.info,  Node: String Values,  Next: Runtime Typed Values,  Prev: Numeric Values,  Up: Values

2.1.2 String Values
-------------------

A value known at compile time to have string type is represented as an
array of 'char'.  String values do not necessarily represent readable
text strings and may contain arbitrary 8-bit data, including null bytes,
control codes, and bytes with the high bit set.  Thus, string values are
not null-terminated strings, but rather opaque arrays of bytes.

   'SYSMIS', 'LOWEST', and 'HIGHEST' have no equivalents as string
values.  Usually, PSPP fills an unknown or undefined string values with
spaces, but PSPP does not treat such a string as a special case when it
processes it later.

   'MAX_STRING', the maximum length of a string value, is defined in
'data/val-type.h'.


File: pspp-dev.info,  Node: Runtime Typed Values,  Prev: String Values,  Up: Values

2.1.3 Runtime Typed Values
--------------------------

When a value's type is only known at runtime, it is often represented as
a 'union value', defined in 'data/value.h'.  A 'union value' does not
identify the type or width of the data it contains.  Code that works
with 'union values's must therefore have external knowledge of its
content, often through the type and width of a 'struct variable' (*note
Variables::).

   'union value' has one member that clients are permitted to access
directly, a 'double' named 'f' that stores the content of a numeric
'union value'.  It has other members that store the content of string
'union value', but client code should use accessor functions instead of
referring to these directly.

   PSPP provides some functions for working with 'union value's.  The
most useful are described below.  To use these functions, recall that a
numeric value has a width of 0.

 -- Function: void value_init (union value *VALUE, int WIDTH)
     Initializes VALUE as a value of the given WIDTH.  After
     initialization, the data in VALUE are indeterminate; the caller is
     responsible for storing initial data in it.

 -- Function: void value_destroy (union value *VALUE, int WIDTH)
     Frees auxiliary storage associated with VALUE, which must have the
     given WIDTH.

 -- Function: bool value_needs_init (int WIDTH)
     For some widths, 'value_init' and 'value_destroy' do not actually
     do anything, because no additional storage is needed beyond the
     size of 'union value'.  This function returns true if WIDTH is such
     a width, which case there is no actual need to call those
     functions.  This can be a useful optimization if a large number of
     'union value's of such a width are to be initialized or destroyed.

     This function returns false if 'value_init' and 'value_destroy' are
     actually required for the given WIDTH.

 -- Function: double value_num (const union value *VALUE)
     Returns the numeric value in VALUE, which must have been
     initialized as a numeric value.  Equivalent to 'VALUE->f'.

 -- Function: const char * value_str (const union value *VALUE, int
          WIDTH)
 -- Function: char * value_str_rw (union value *VALUE, int WIDTH)
     Returns the string value in VALUE, which must have been initialized
     with positive width WIDTH.  The string returned is not
     null-terminated.  Only WIDTH bytes of returned data may be
     accessed.

     The two different functions exist only for 'const'-correctness.
     Otherwise they are identical.

     It is important that WIDTH be the correct value that was passed to
     'value_init'.  Passing a smaller or larger value (e.g. because that
     number of bytes will be accessed) will not always work and should
     be avoided.

 -- Function: void value_copy (union value *DST, const union value *SRC,
          int WIDTH)
     Copies the contents of 'union value' SRC to DST.  Both DST and SRC
     must have been initialized with the specified WIDTH.

 -- Function: void value_set_missing (union value *VALUE, int WIDTH)
     Sets VALUE to 'SYSMIS' if it is numeric or to all spaces if it is
     alphanumeric, according to WIDTH.  VALUE must have been initialized
     with the specified WIDTH.

 -- Function: bool value_is_resizable (const union value *VALUE, int
          OLD_WIDTH, int NEW_WIDTH)
     Determines whether VALUE, which must have been initialized with the
     specified OLD_WIDTH, may be resized to NEW_WIDTH.  Resizing is
     possible if the following criteria are met.  First, OLD_WIDTH and
     NEW_WIDTH must be both numeric or both string widths.  Second, if
     NEW_WIDTH is a short string width and less than OLD_WIDTH, resizing
     is allowed only if bytes NEW_WIDTH through OLD_WIDTH in VALUE
     contain only spaces.

     These rules are part of those used by 'mv_is_resizable' and
     'val_labs_can_set_width'.

 -- Function: void value_resize (union value *VALUE, int OLD_WIDTH, int
          NEW_WIDTH)
     Resizes VALUE from OLD_WIDTH to NEW_WIDTH, which must be allowed by
     the rules stated above.  VALUE must have been initialized with the
     specified OLD_WIDTH before calling this function.  After resizing,
     VALUE has width NEW_WIDTH.

     If NEW_WIDTH is greater than OLD_WIDTH, VALUE will be padded on the
     right with spaces to the new width.  If NEW_WIDTH is less than
     OLD_WIDTH, the rightmost bytes of VALUE are truncated.

 -- Function: bool value_equal (const union value *A, const union value
          *B, int WIDTH)
     Compares of A and B, which must both have width WIDTH.  Returns
     true if their contents are the same, false if they differ.

 -- Function: int value_compare_3way (const union value *A, const union
          value *B, int WIDTH)
     Compares of A and B, which must both have width WIDTH.  Returns -1
     if A is less than B, 0 if they are equal, or 1 if A is greater than
     B.

     Numeric values are compared numerically, with 'SYSMIS' comparing
     less than any real number.  String values are compared
     lexicographically byte-by-byte.

 -- Function: size_t value_hash (const union value *VALUE, int WIDTH,
          unsigned int BASIS)
     Computes and returns a hash of VALUE, which must have the specified
     WIDTH.  The value in BASIS is folded into the hash.

2.2 Input and Output Formats
============================

Input and output formats specify how to convert data fields to and from
data values (*note (pspp)Input and Output Formats::).  PSPP uses 'struct
fmt_spec' to represent input and output formats.

   Function prototypes and other declarations related to formats are in
the '<data/format.h>' header.

 -- Structure: struct fmt_spec
     An input or output format, with the following members:

     'enum fmt_type type'
          The format type (see below).

     'int w'
          Field width, in bytes.  The width of numeric fields is always
          between 1 and 40 bytes, and the width of string fields is
          always between 1 and 65534 bytes.  However, many individual
          types of formats place stricter limits on field width (see
          *note fmt_max_input_width::, *note fmt_max_output_width::).

     'int d'
          Number of decimal places, in character positions.  For format
          types that do not allow decimal places to be specified, this
          value must be 0.  Format types that do allow decimal places
          have type-specific and often width-specific restrictions on
          'd' (see *note fmt_max_input_decimals::, *note
          fmt_max_output_decimals::).

 -- Enumeration: enum fmt_type
     An enumerated type representing an input or output format type.
     Each PSPP input and output format has a corresponding enumeration
     constant prefixed by 'FMT': 'FMT_F', 'FMT_COMMA', 'FMT_DOT', and so
     on.

   The following sections describe functions for manipulating formats
and the data in fields represented by formats.

* Obtaining Properties of Format Types::
* Numeric Formatting Styles::
* Formatted Data Input and Output::


File: pspp-dev.info,  Node: Constructing and Verifying Formats,  Next: Format Utility Functions,  Up: Input and Output Formats

2.2.1 Constructing and Verifying Formats
----------------------------------------

These functions construct 'struct fmt_spec's and verify that they are
valid.

 -- Function: struct fmt_spec fmt_for_input (enum fmt_type TYPE, int W,
          int D)
 -- Function: struct fmt_spec fmt_for_output (enum fmt_type TYPE, int W,
          int D)
     Constructs a 'struct fmt_spec' with the given TYPE, W, and D,
     asserts that the result is a valid input (or output) format, and
     returns it.

 -- Function: struct fmt_spec fmt_for_output_from_input (const struct
          fmt_spec *INPUT)
     Given INPUT, which must be a valid input format, returns the
     equivalent output format.  *Note (pspp)Input and Output Formats::,
     for the rules for converting input formats into output formats.

 -- Function: struct fmt_spec fmt_default_for_width (int WIDTH)
     Returns the default output format for a variable of the given
     WIDTH.  For a numeric variable, this is F8.2 format; for a string
     variable, it is the A format of the given WIDTH.

   The following functions check whether a 'struct fmt_spec' is valid
for various uses and return true if so, false otherwise.  When any of
them returns false, it also outputs an explanatory error message using
'msg'.  To suppress error output, enclose a call to one of these
functions by a 'msg_disable'/'msg_enable' pair.

 -- Function: bool fmt_check (const struct fmt_spec *FORMAT, bool
          FOR_INPUT)
 -- Function: bool fmt_check_input (const struct fmt_spec *FORMAT)
 -- Function: bool fmt_check_output (const struct fmt_spec *FORMAT)
     Checks whether FORMAT is a valid input format (for
     'fmt_check_input', or 'fmt_check' if FOR_INPUT) or output format
     (for 'fmt_check_output', or 'fmt_check' if not FOR_INPUT).

 -- Function: bool fmt_check_type_compat (const struct fmt_spec *FORMAT,
          enum val_type TYPE)
     Checks whether FORMAT matches the value type TYPE, that is, if TYPE
     is 'VAL_NUMERIC' and FORMAT is a numeric format or TYPE is
     'VAL_STRING' and FORMAT is a string format.

 -- Function: bool fmt_check_width_compat (const struct fmt_spec
          *FORMAT, int WIDTH)
     Checks whether FORMAT may be used as an output format for a value
     of the given WIDTH.

     'fmt_var_width', described in the following section, can be also be
     used to determine the value width needed by a format.


File: pspp-dev.info,  Node: Format Utility Functions,  Next: Obtaining Properties of Format Types,  Prev: Constructing and Verifying Formats,  Up: Input and Output Formats

2.2.2 Format Utility Functions
------------------------------

These functions work with 'struct fmt_spec's.

 -- Function: int fmt_var_width (const struct fmt_spec *FORMAT)
     Returns the width for values associated with FORMAT.  If FORMAT is
     a numeric format, the width is 0; if FORMAT is an A format, then
     the width 'FORMAT->w'; otherwise, FORMAT is an AHEX format and its
     width is 'FORMAT->w / 2'.

 -- Function: char *fmt_to_string (const struct fmt_spec *FORMAT, char
          S[FMT_STRING_LEN_MAX + 1])
     Converts FORMAT to a human-readable format specifier in S and
     returns S.  FORMAT need not be a valid input or output format
     specifier, e.g. it is allowed to have an excess width or decimal
     places.  In particular, if FORMAT has decimals, they are included
     in the output string, even if FORMAT's type does not allow
     decimals, to allow accurately presenting incorrect formats to the
     user.

 -- Function: bool fmt_equal (const struct fmt_spec *A, const struct
          fmt_spec *B)
     Compares A and B memberwise and returns true if they are identical,
     false otherwise.  FORMAT need not be a valid input or output format
     specifier.

 -- Function: void fmt_resize (struct fmt_spec *FMT, int WIDTH)
     Sets the width of FMT to a valid format for a 'union value' of size
     WIDTH.


File: pspp-dev.info,  Node: Obtaining Properties of Format Types,  Next: Numeric Formatting Styles,  Prev: Format Utility Functions,  Up: Input and Output Formats

2.2.3 Obtaining Properties of Format Types
------------------------------------------

These functions work with 'enum fmt_type's instead of the higher-level
'struct fmt_spec's.  Their primary purpose is to report properties of
each possible format type, which in turn allows clients to abstract away
many of the details of the very heterogeneous requirements of each
format type.

   The first group of functions works with format type names.

 -- Function: const char *fmt_name (enum fmt_type TYPE)
     Returns the name for the given TYPE, e.g. '"COMMA"' for
     'FMT_COMMA'.

 -- Function: bool fmt_from_name (const char *NAME, enum fmt_type *TYPE)
     Tries to find the 'enum fmt_type' associated with NAME.  If
     successful, sets '*TYPE' to the type and returns true; otherwise,
     returns false without modifying '*TYPE'.

   The functions below query basic limits on width and decimal places
for each kind of format.

 -- Function: bool fmt_takes_decimals (enum fmt_type TYPE)
     Returns true if a format of the given TYPE is allowed to have a
     nonzero number of decimal places (the 'd' member of 'struct
     fmt_spec'), false if not.

 -- Function: int fmt_min_input_width (enum fmt_type TYPE)
 -- Function: int fmt_max_input_width (enum fmt_type TYPE)
 -- Function: int fmt_min_output_width (enum fmt_type TYPE)
 -- Function: int fmt_max_output_width (enum fmt_type TYPE)
     Returns the minimum or maximum width (the 'w' member of 'struct
     fmt_spec') allowed for an input or output format of the specified
     TYPE.

 -- Function: int fmt_max_input_decimals (enum fmt_type TYPE, int WIDTH)
 -- Function: int fmt_max_output_decimals (enum fmt_type TYPE, int
          WIDTH)
     Returns the maximum number of decimal places allowed for an input
     or output format, respectively, of the given TYPE and WIDTH.
     Returns 0 if the specified TYPE does not allow any decimal places
     or if WIDTH is too narrow to allow decimal places.

 -- Function: int fmt_step_width (enum fmt_type TYPE)
     Returns the "width step" for a 'struct fmt_spec' of the given TYPE.
     A 'struct fmt_spec''s width must be a multiple of its type's width
     step.  Most format types have a width step of 1, so that their
     formats' widths may be any integer within the valid range, but
     hexadecimal numeric formats and AHEX string formats have a width
     step of 2.

   These functions allow clients to broadly determine how each kind of
input or output format behaves.

 -- Function: bool fmt_is_string (enum fmt_type TYPE)
 -- Function: bool fmt_is_numeric (enum fmt_type TYPE)
     Returns true if TYPE is a format for numeric or string values,
     respectively, false otherwise.

 -- Function: enum fmt_category fmt_get_category (enum fmt_type TYPE)
     Returns the category within which TYPE falls.

      -- Enumeration: enum fmt_category
          A group of format types.  Format type categories correspond to
          the input and output categories described in the PSPP user
          documentation (*note (pspp)Input and Output Formats::).

          Each format is in exactly one category.  The categories have
          bitwise disjoint values to make it easy to test whether a
          format type is in one of multiple categories, e.g.

               if (fmt_get_category (type) & (FMT_CAT_DATE | FMT_CAT_TIME))
                 {
                   /* ...'type' is a date or time format... */
                 }

          The format categories are:
          'FMT_CAT_BASIC'
               Basic numeric formats.

          'FMT_CAT_CUSTOM'
               Custom currency formats.

          'FMT_CAT_LEGACY'
               Legacy numeric formats.

          'FMT_CAT_BINARY'
               Binary formats.

          'FMT_CAT_HEXADECIMAL'
               Hexadecimal formats.

          'FMT_CAT_DATE'
               Date formats.

          'FMT_CAT_TIME'
               Time formats.

          'FMT_CAT_DATE_COMPONENT'
               Date component formats.

          'FMT_CAT_STRING'
               String formats.

   The PSPP input and output routines use the following pair of
functions to convert 'enum fmt_type's to and from the separate set of
codes used in system and portable files:

 -- Function: int fmt_to_io (enum fmt_type TYPE)
     Returns the format code used in system and portable files that
     corresponds to TYPE.

 -- Function: bool fmt_from_io (int IO, enum fmt_type *TYPE)
     Converts IO, a format code used in system and portable files, into
     a 'enum fmt_type' in '*TYPE'.  Returns true if successful, false if
     IO is not valid.

   These functions reflect the relationship between input and output
formats.

 -- Function: enum fmt_type fmt_input_to_output (enum fmt_type TYPE)
     Returns the output format type that is used by default by DATA LIST
     and other input procedures when TYPE is specified as an input
     format.  The conversion from input format to output format is more
     complicated than simply changing the format.  *Note
     fmt_for_output_from_input::, for a function that performs the
     entire conversion.

 -- Function: bool fmt_usable_for_input (enum fmt_type TYPE)
     Returns true if TYPE may be used as an input format type, false
     otherwise.  The custom currency formats, in particular, may be used
     for output but not for input.

     All format types are valid for output.

   The final group of format type property functions obtain
human-readable templates that illustrate the formats graphically.

 -- Function: const char *fmt_date_template (enum fmt_type TYPE)
     Returns a formatting template for TYPE, which must be a date or
     time format type.  These formats are used by 'data_in' and
     'data_out' to guide parsing and formatting date and time data.

 -- Function: char *fmt_dollar_template (const struct fmt_spec *FORMAT)
     Returns a string of the form '$#,###.##' according to FORMAT, which
     must be of type 'FMT_DOLLAR'.  The caller must free the string with
     'free'.

2.2.4 Numeric Formatting Styles
-------------------------------

Each of the basic numeric formats (F, E, COMMA, DOT, DOLLAR, PCT) and
custom currency formats (CCA, CCB, CCC, CCD, CCE) has an associated
numeric formatting style, represented by 'struct fmt_number_style'.
Input and output conversion of formats that have numeric styles is
determined mainly by the style, although the formatting rules have
special cases that are not represented within the style.

 -- Structure: struct fmt_number_style
     A structure type with the following members:

     'struct substring neg_prefix'
     'struct substring prefix'
     'struct substring suffix'
     'struct substring neg_suffix'
          A set of strings used a prefix to negative numbers, a prefix
          to every number, a suffix to every number, and a suffix to
          negative numbers, respectively.  Each of these strings is no
          more than 'FMT_STYLE_AFFIX_MAX' bytes (currently 16) bytes in
          length.  These strings must be freed with 'ss_dealloc' when no
          longer needed.

     'decimal'
          The character used as a decimal point.  It must be either '.'
          or ','.

     'grouping'
          The character used for grouping digits to the left of the
          decimal point.  It may be '.' or ',', in which case it must
          not be equal to 'decimal', or it may be set to 0 to disable
          grouping.

   The following functions are provided for working with numeric
formatting styles.

 -- Function: void fmt_number_style_init (struct fmt_number_style
          *STYLE)
     Initialises a 'struct fmt_number_style' with all of the prefixes
     and suffixes set to the empty string, '.' as the decimal point
     character, and grouping disables.

 -- Function: void fmt_number_style_destroy (struct fmt_number_style
          *STYLE)
     Destroys STYLE, freeing its storage.

 -- Function: struct fmt_number_style *fmt_create (void)
     A function which creates an array of all the styles used by pspp,
     and calls fmt_number_style_init on each of them.

 -- Function: void fmt_done (struct fmt_number_style *STYLES)
     A wrapper function which takes an array of 'struct
     fmt_number_style', calls fmt_number_style_destroy on each of them,
     and then frees the array.

 -- Function: int fmt_affix_width (const struct fmt_number_style *STYLE)
     Returns the total length of STYLE's 'prefix' and 'suffix'.

 -- Function: int fmt_neg_affix_width (const struct fmt_number_style
          *STYLE)
     Returns the total length of STYLE's 'neg_prefix' and 'neg_suffix'.

   PSPP maintains a global set of number styles for each of the basic
numeric formats and custom currency formats.  The following functions
work with these global styles:

 -- Function: const struct fmt_number_style * fmt_get_style (enum
          fmt_type TYPE)
     Returns the numeric style for the given format TYPE.

 -- Function: const char * fmt_name (enum fmt_type TYPE)
     Returns the name of the given format TYPE.

2.2.5 Formatted Data Input and Output
-------------------------------------

These functions provide the ability to convert data fields into 'union
value's and vice versa.

 -- Function: bool data_in (struct substring INPUT, const char
          *ENCODING, enum fmt_type TYPE, int IMPLIED_DECIMALS, int
          FIRST_COLUMN, const struct dictionary *DICT, union value
          *OUTPUT, int WIDTH)
     Parses INPUT as a field containing data in the given format TYPE.
     The resulting value is stored in OUTPUT, which the caller must have
     initialized with the given WIDTH.  For consistency, WIDTH must be 0
     if TYPE is a numeric format type and greater than 0 if TYPE is a
     string format type.  ENCODING should be set to indicate the
     character encoding of INPUT.  DICT must be a pointer to the
     dictionary with which OUTPUT is associated.

     If INPUT is the empty string (with length 0), OUTPUT is set to the
     value set on SET BLANKS (*note (pspp)SET BLANKS::) for a numeric
     value, or to all spaces for a string value.  This applies
     regardless of the usual parsing requirements for TYPE.

     If IMPLIED_DECIMALS is greater than zero, then the numeric result
     is shifted right by IMPLIED_DECIMALS decimal places if INPUT does
     not contain a decimal point character or an exponent.  Only certain
     numeric format types support implied decimal places; for string
     formats and other numeric formats, IMPLIED_DECIMALS has no effect.
     DATA LIST FIXED is the primary user of this feature (*note
     (pspp)DATA LIST FIXED::).  Other callers should generally specify 0
     for IMPLIED_DECIMALS, to disable this feature.

     When INPUT contains invalid input data, 'data_in' outputs a message
     using 'msg'.  If FIRST_COLUMN is nonzero, it is included in any
     such error message as the 1-based column number of the start of the
     field.  The last column in the field is calculated as FIRST_COLUMN
     + INPUT - 1.  To suppress error output, enclose the call to
     'data_in' by calls to 'msg_disable' and 'msg_enable'.

     This function returns true on success, false if a message was
     output (even if suppressed).  Overflow and underflow provoke
     warnings but are not propagated to the caller as errors.

     This function is declared in 'data/data-in.h'.

 -- Function: char * data_out (const union value *INPUT, const struct
          fmt_spec *FORMAT)
 -- Function: char * data_out_legacy (const union value *INPUT, const
          char *ENCODING, const struct fmt_spec *FORMAT)
     Converts the data pointed to by INPUT into a string value, which
     will be encoded in UTF-8, according to output format specifier
     FORMAT.  Format must be a valid output format.  The width of INPUT
     is inferred from FORMAT using an algorithm equivalent to
     'fmt_var_width'.

     When INPUT contains data that cannot be represented in the given
     FORMAT, 'data_out' may output a message using 'msg', although the
     current implementation does not consistently do so.  To suppress
     error output, enclose the call to 'data_out' by calls to
     'msg_disable' and 'msg_enable'.

     This function is declared in 'data/data-out.h'.

2.3 User-Missing Values
=======================

In addition to the system-missing value for numeric values, each
variable has a set of user-missing values (*note (pspp)MISSING
VALUES::).  A set of user-missing values is represented by 'struct
missing_values'.

   It is rarely necessary to interact directly with a 'struct
missing_values' object.  Instead, the most common operation, querying
whether a particular value is a missing value for a given variable, is
most conveniently executed through functions on 'struct variable'.
*Note Variable Missing Values::, for details.

   A 'struct missing_values' is essentially a set of 'union value's that
have a common value width (*note Values::).  For a set of missing values
associated with a variable (the common case), the set's width is the
same as the variable's width.

   Function prototypes and other declarations related to missing values
are declared in 'data/missing-values.h'.

 -- Structure: struct missing_values
     Opaque type that represents a set of missing values.

   The contents of a set of missing values is subject to some
restrictions.  Regardless of width, a set of missing values is allowed
to be empty.  A set of numeric missing values may contain up to three
discrete numeric values, or a range of numeric values (which includes
both ends of the range), or a range plus one discrete numeric value.  A
set of string missing values may contain up to three discrete string
values (with the same width as the set), but ranges are not supported.

   In addition, values in string missing values wider than
'MV_MAX_STRING' bytes may contain non-space characters only in their
first 'MV_MAX_STRING' bytes; all the bytes after the first
'MV_MAX_STRING' must be spaces.  *Note mv_is_acceptable::, for a
function that tests a value against these constraints.

 -- Macro: int MV_MAX_STRING
     Number of bytes in a string missing value that are not required to
     be spaces.  The current value is 8, a value which is fixed by the
     system file format.  In PSPP we could easily eliminate this
     restriction, but doing so would also require us to extend the
     system file format in an incompatible way, which we consider a bad
     tradeoff.

   The most often useful functions for missing values are those for
testing whether a given value is missing, described in the following
section.  Several other functions for creating, inspecting, and
modifying 'struct missing_values' objects are described afterward, but
these functions are much more rarely useful.

2.3.1 Testing for Missing Values
--------------------------------

The most often useful functions for missing values are those for testing
whether a given value is missing, described here.  However, using one of
the corresponding missing value testing functions for variables can be
even easier (*note Variable Missing Values::).

 -- Function: bool mv_is_value_missing (const struct missing_values *MV,
          const union value *VALUE, enum mv_class CLASS)
 -- Function: bool mv_is_num_missing (const struct missing_values *MV,
          double VALUE, enum mv_class CLASS)
 -- Function: bool mv_is_str_missing (const struct missing_values *MV,
          const char VALUE[], enum mv_class CLASS)
     Tests whether VALUE is in one of the categories of missing values
     given by CLASS.  Returns true if so, false otherwise.

     MV determines the width of VALUE and provides the set of
     user-missing values to test.

     The only difference among these functions in the form in which
     VALUE is provided, so you may use whichever function is most
     convenient.

     The CLASS argument determines the exact kinds of missing values
     that the functions test for:

      -- Enumeration: enum mv_class
          MV_USER
               Returns true if VALUE is in the set of user-missing
               values given by MV.

          MV_SYSTEM
               Returns true if VALUE is system-missing.  (If MV
               represents a set of string values, then VALUE is never
               system-missing.)

          MV_ANY
          MV_USER | MV_SYSTEM
               Returns true if VALUE is user-missing or system-missing.

          MV_NONE
               Always returns false, that is, VALUE is never considered
               missing.

2.3.2 Creation and Destruction
------------------------------

These functions create and destroy 'struct missing_values' objects.

 -- Function: void mv_init (struct missing_values *MV, int WIDTH)
     Initializes MV as a set of user-missing values.  The set is
     initially empty.  Any values added to it must have the specified
     WIDTH.

 -- Function: void mv_destroy (struct missing_values *MV)
     Destroys MV, which must not be referred to again.

 -- Function: void mv_copy (struct missing_values *MV, const struct
          missing_values *OLD)
     Initializes MV as a copy of the existing set of user-missing values
     OLD.

 -- Function: void mv_clear (struct missing_values *MV)
     Empties the user-missing value set MV, retaining its existing
     width.


File: pspp-dev.info,  Node: Changing User-Missing Value Set Width,  Next: Inspecting User-Missing Value Sets,  Prev: Creating and Destroying User-Missing Values,  Up: User-Missing Values

2.3.3 Changing User-Missing Value Set Width
-------------------------------------------

A few PSPP language constructs copy sets of user-missing values from one
variable to another.  When the source and target variables have the same
width, this is simple.  But when the target variable's width might be
different from the source variable's, it takes a little more work.  The
functions described here can help.

   In fact, it is usually unnecessary to call these functions directly.
Most of the time 'var_set_missing_values', which uses 'mv_resize'
internally to resize the new set of missing values to the required
width, may be used instead.  *Note var_set_missing_values::, for more
information.

 -- Function: bool mv_is_resizable (const struct missing_values *MV, int
          NEW_WIDTH)
     Tests whether MV's width may be changed to NEW_WIDTH using
     'mv_resize'.  Returns true if it is allowed, false otherwise.

     If MV contains any missing values, then it may be resized only if
     each missing value may be resized, as determined by
     'value_is_resizable' (*note value_is_resizable::).

 -- Function: void mv_resize (struct missing_values *MV, int WIDTH)
     Changes MV's width to WIDTH.  MV and WIDTH must satisfy the
     constraints explained above.

     When a string missing value set's width is increased, each
     user-missing value is padded on the right with spaces to the new
     width.


File: pspp-dev.info,  Node: Inspecting User-Missing Value Sets,  Next: Modifying User-Missing Value Sets,  Prev: Changing User-Missing Value Set Width,  Up: User-Missing Values

2.3.4 Inspecting User-Missing Value Sets
----------------------------------------

These functions inspect the properties and contents of 'struct
missing_values' objects.

   The first set of functions inspects the discrete values that sets of
user-missing values may contain:

 -- Function: bool mv_is_empty (const struct missing_values *MV)
     Returns true if MV contains no user-missing values, false if it
     contains at least one user-missing value (either a discrete value
     or a numeric range).

 -- Function: int mv_get_width (const struct missing_values *MV)
     Returns the width of the user-missing values that MV represents.

 -- Function: int mv_n_values (const struct missing_values *MV)
     Returns the number of discrete user-missing values included in MV.
     The return value will be between 0 and 3.  For sets of numeric
     user-missing values that include a range, the return value will be
     0 or 1.

 -- Function: bool mv_has_value (const struct missing_values *MV)
     Returns true if MV has at least one discrete user-missing values,
     that is, if 'mv_n_values' would return nonzero for MV.

 -- Function: const union value * mv_get_value (const struct
          missing_values *MV, int INDEX)
     Returns the discrete user-missing value in MV with the given INDEX.
     The caller must not modify or free the returned value or refer to
     it after modifying or freeing MV.  The index must be less than the
     number of discrete user-missing values in MV, as reported by
     'mv_n_values'.

   The second set of functions inspects the single range of values that
numeric sets of user-missing values may contain:

 -- Function: bool mv_has_range (const struct missing_values *MV)
     Returns true if MV includes a range, false otherwise.

 -- Function: void mv_get_range (const struct missing_values *MV, double
          *LOW, double *HIGH)
     Stores the low endpoint of MV's range in '*LOW' and the high
     endpoint of the range in '*HIGH'.  MV must include a range.


File: pspp-dev.info,  Node: Modifying User-Missing Value Sets,  Prev: Inspecting User-Missing Value Sets,  Up: User-Missing Values

2.3.5 Modifying User-Missing Value Sets
---------------------------------------

These functions modify the contents of 'struct missing_values' objects.

   The next set of functions applies to all sets of user-missing values:

 -- Function: bool mv_add_value (struct missing_values *MV, const union
          value *VALUE)
 -- Function: bool mv_add_str (struct missing_values *MV, const char
          VALUE[])
 -- Function: bool mv_add_num (struct missing_values *MV, double VALUE)
     Attempts to add the given discrete VALUE to set of user-missing
     values MV.  VALUE must have the same width as MV.  Returns true if
     VALUE was successfully added, false if the set could not accept any
     more discrete values or if VALUE is not an acceptable user-missing
     value (see 'mv_is_acceptable' below).

     These functions are equivalent, except for the form in which VALUE
     is provided, so you may use whichever function is most convenient.

 -- Function: void mv_pop_value (struct missing_values *MV, union value
          *VALUE)
     Removes a discrete value from MV (which must contain at least one
     discrete value) and stores it in VALUE.

 -- Function: bool mv_replace_value (struct missing_values *MV, const
          union value *VALUE, int INDEX)
     Attempts to replace the discrete value with the given INDEX in MV
     (which must contain at least INDEX + 1 discrete values) by VALUE.
     Returns true if successful, false if VALUE is not an acceptable
     user-missing value (see 'mv_is_acceptable' below).

 -- Function: bool mv_is_acceptable (const union value *VALUE, int
          WIDTH)
     Returns true if VALUE, which must have the specified WIDTH, may be
     added to a missing value set of the same WIDTH, false if it cannot.
     As described above, all numeric values and string values of width
     'MV_MAX_STRING' or less may be added, but string value of greater
     width may be added only if bytes beyond the first 'MV_MAX_STRING'
     are all spaces.

   The second set of functions applies only to numeric sets of
user-missing values:

 -- Function: bool mv_add_range (struct missing_values *MV, double LOW,
          double HIGH)
     Attempts to add a numeric range covering LOW...HIGH (inclusive on
     both ends) to MV, which must be a numeric set of user-missing
     values.  Returns true if the range is successful added, false on
     failure.  Fails if MV already contains a range, or if MV contains
     more than one discrete value, or if LOW > HIGH.

 -- Function: void mv_pop_range (struct missing_values *MV, double *LOW,
          double *HIGH)
     Given MV, which must be a numeric set of user-missing values that
     contains a range, removes that range from MV and stores its low
     endpoint in '*LOW' and its high endpoint in '*HIGH'.


File: pspp-dev.info,  Node: Value Labels,  Next: Variables,  Prev: User-Missing Values,  Up: Basic Concepts

2.4 Value Labels
================

Each variable has a set of value labels (*note (pspp)VALUE LABELS::),
represented as 'struct val_labs'.  A 'struct val_labs' is essentially a
map from 'union value's to strings.  All of the values in a set of value
labels have the same width, which for a set of value labels owned by a
variable (the common case) is the same as its variable.

   Sets of value labels may contain any number of entries.

   It is rarely necessary to interact directly with a 'struct val_labs'
object.  Instead, the most common operation, looking up the label for a
value of a given variable, can be conveniently executed through
functions on 'struct variable'.  *Note Variable Value Labels::, for
details.

   Function prototypes and other declarations related to missing values
are declared in 'data/value-labels.h'.

 -- Structure: struct val_labs
     Opaque type that represents a set of value labels.

   The most often useful function for value labels is 'val_labs_find',
for looking up the label associated with a value.

 -- Function: char * val_labs_find (const struct val_labs *VAL_LABS,
          union value VALUE)
     Looks in VAL_LABS for a label for the given VALUE.  Returns the
     label, if one is found, or a null pointer otherwise.

   Several other functions for working with value labels are described
in the following section, but these are more rarely useful.

2.4.1 Creation and Destruction
------------------------------

These functions create and destroy 'struct val_labs' objects.

 -- Function: struct val_labs * val_labs_create (int WIDTH)
     Creates and returns an initially empty set of value labels with the
     given WIDTH.

 -- Function: struct val_labs * val_labs_clone (const struct val_labs
          *VAL_LABS)
     Creates and returns a set of value labels whose width and contents
     are the same as those of VAR_LABS.

 -- Function: void val_labs_clear (struct val_labs *VAR_LABS)
     Deletes all value labels from VAR_LABS.

 -- Function: void val_labs_destroy (struct val_labs *VAR_LABS)
     Destroys VAR_LABS, which must not be referenced again.

2.4.2 Value Labels Properties
-----------------------------

These functions inspect and manipulate basic properties of 'struct
val_labs' objects.

 -- Function: size_t val_labs_count (const struct val_labs *VAL_LABS)
     Returns the number of value labels in VAL_LABS.

 -- Function: bool val_labs_can_set_width (const struct val_labs
          *VAL_LABS, int NEW_WIDTH)
     Tests whether VAL_LABS's width may be changed to NEW_WIDTH using
     'val_labs_set_width'.  Returns true if it is allowed, false
     otherwise.

     A set of value labels may be resized to a given width only if each
     value in it may be resized to that width, as determined by
     'value_is_resizable' (*note value_is_resizable::).

 -- Function: void val_labs_set_width (struct val_labs *VAL_LABS, int
          NEW_WIDTH)
     Changes the width of VAL_LABS's values to NEW_WIDTH, which must be
     a valid new width as determined by 'val_labs_can_set_width'.


File: pspp-dev.info,  Node: Value Labels Adding and Removing Labels,  Next: Value Labels Iteration,  Prev: Value Labels Properties,  Up: Value Labels

2.4.3 Adding and Removing Labels
--------------------------------

These functions add and remove value labels from a 'struct val_labs'
object.

 -- Function: bool val_labs_add (struct val_labs *VAL_LABS, union value
          VALUE, const char *LABEL)
     Adds LABEL to in VAR_LABS as a label for VALUE, which must have the
     same width as the set of value labels.  Returns true if successful,
     false if VALUE already has a label.

 -- Function: void val_labs_replace (struct val_labs *VAL_LABS, union
          value VALUE, const char *LABEL)
     Adds LABEL to in VAR_LABS as a label for VALUE, which must have the
     same width as the set of value labels.  If VALUE already has a
     label in VAR_LABS, it is replaced.

 -- Function: bool val_labs_remove (struct val_labs *VAL_LABS, union
          value VALUE)
     Removes from VAL_LABS any label for VALUE, which must have the same
     width as the set of value labels.  Returns true if a label was
     removed, false otherwise.


File: pspp-dev.info,  Node: Value Labels Iteration,  Prev: Value Labels Adding and Removing Labels,  Up: Value Labels

2.4.4 Iterating through Value Labels
------------------------------------

These functions allow iteration through the set of value labels
represented by a 'struct val_labs' object.  They may be used in the
context of a 'for' loop:

     struct val_labs val_labs;
     const struct val_lab *vl;

     ...

     for (vl = val_labs_first (val_labs); vl != NULL;
          vl = val_labs_next (val_labs, vl))
       {
         ...do something with 'vl'...
       }

   Value labels should not be added or deleted from a 'struct val_labs'
as it is undergoing iteration.

 -- Function: const struct val_lab * val_labs_first (const struct
          val_labs *VAL_LABS)
     Returns the first value label in VAR_LABS, if it contains at least
     one value label, or a null pointer if it does not contain any value
     labels.

 -- Function: const struct val_lab * val_labs_next (const struct
          val_labs *VAL_LABS, const struct val_labs_iterator **VL)
     Returns the value label in VAR_LABS following VL, if VL is not the
     last value label in VAL_LABS, or a null pointer if there are no
     value labels following VL.

 -- Function: const struct val_lab ** val_labs_sorted (const struct
          val_labs *VAL_LABS)
     Allocates and returns an array of pointers to value labels, which
     are sorted in increasing order by value.  The array has
     'val_labs_count (VAL_LABS)' elements.  The caller is responsible
     for freeing the array with 'free' (but must not free any of the
     'struct val_lab' elements that the array points to).

   The iteration functions above work with pointers to 'struct val_lab'
which is an opaque data structure that users of 'struct val_labs' must
not modify or free directly.  The following functions work with objects
of this type:

 -- Function: const union value * val_lab_get_value (const struct
          val_lab *VL)
     Returns the value of value label VL.  The caller must not modify or
     free the returned value.  (To achieve a similar result, remove the
     value label with 'val_labs_remove', then add the new value with
     'val_labs_add'.)

     The width of the returned value cannot be determined directly from
     VL.  It may be obtained by calling 'val_labs_get_width' on the
     'struct val_labs' that VL is in.

 -- Function: const char * val_lab_get_label (const struct val_lab *VL)
     Returns the label in VL as a null-terminated string.  The caller
     must not modify or free the returned string.  (Use

2.5 Variables
=============

A PSPP variable is represented by 'struct variable', an opaque type
declared in 'data/variable.h' along with related declarations.  *Note
(pspp)Variables::, for a description of PSPP variables from a user
perspective.

   PSPP is unusual among computer languages in that, by itself, a PSPP
variable does not have a value.  Instead, a variable in PSPP takes on a
value only in the context of a case, which supplies one value for each
variable in a set of variables (*note Cases::).  The set of variables in
a case, in turn, are ordinarily part of a dictionary (*note
Dictionaries::).

   Every variable has several attributes, most of which correspond
directly to one of the variable attributes visible to PSPP users (*note
(pspp)Attributes::).

   The following sections describe variable-related functions and
macros.

2.5.1 Variable Name
-------------------

A variable name is a string between 1 and 'ID_MAX_LEN' bytes long that
satisfies the rules for PSPP identifiers (*note (pspp)Tokens::).
Variable names are mixed-case and treated case-insensitively.

 -- Macro: int ID_MAX_LEN
     Maximum length of a variable name, in bytes, currently 64.

   Only one commonly useful function relates to variable names:

 -- Function: const char * var_get_name (const struct variable *VAR)
     Returns VAR's variable name as a C string.

   A few other functions are much more rarely used.  Some of these
functions are used internally by the dictionary implementation:

 -- Function: void var_set_name (struct variable *VAR, const char
          *NEW_NAME)
     Changes the name of VAR to NEW_NAME, which must be a "plausible"
     name as defined below.

     This function cannot be applied to a variable that is part of a
     dictionary.  Use 'dict_rename_var' instead (*note Dictionary
     Renaming Variables::).

 -- Function: enum dict_class var_get_dict_class (const struct variable
          *VAR)
     Returns the dictionary class of VAR's name (*note Dictionary
     Class::).


File: pspp-dev.info,  Node: Variable Type and Width,  Next: Variable Missing Values,  Prev: Variable Name,  Up: Variables

2.5.2 Variable Type and Width
-----------------------------

A variable's type and width are the type and width of its values (*note
Values::).

 -- Function: enum val_type var_get_type (const struct variable *VAR)
     Returns the type of variable VAR.

 -- Function: int var_get_width (const struct variable *VAR)
     Returns the width of variable VAR.

 -- Function: void var_set_width (struct variable *VAR, int WIDTH)
     Sets the width of variable VAR to WIDTH.  The width of a variable
     should not normally be changed after the variable is created, so
     this function is rarely used.  This function cannot be applied to a
     variable that is part of a dictionary.

 -- Function: bool var_is_numeric (const struct variable *VAR)
     Returns true if VAR is a numeric variable, false otherwise.

 -- Function: bool var_is_alpha (const struct variable *VAR)
     Returns true if VAR is an alphanumeric (string) variable, false
     otherwise.


File: pspp-dev.info,  Node: Variable Missing Values,  Next: Variable Value Labels,  Prev: Variable Type and Width,  Up: Variables

2.5.3 Variable Missing Values
-----------------------------

A numeric or short string variable may have a set of user-missing values
(*note (pspp)MISSING VALUES::), represented as a 'struct missing_values'
(*note User-Missing Values::).

   The most frequent operation on a variable's missing values is to
query whether a value is user- or system-missing:

 -- Function: bool var_is_value_missing (const struct variable *VAR,
          const union value *VALUE, enum mv_class CLASS)
 -- Function: bool var_is_num_missing (const struct variable *VAR,
          double VALUE, enum mv_class CLASS)
 -- Function: bool var_is_str_missing (const struct variable *VAR, const
          char VALUE[], enum mv_class CLASS)
     Tests whether VALUE is a missing value of the given CLASS for
     variable VAR and returns true if so, false otherwise.
     'var_is_num_missing' may only be applied to numeric variables;
     'var_is_str_missing' may only be applied to string variables.
     VALUE must have been initialized with the same width as VAR.

     'var_is_TYPE_missing (VAR, VALUE, CLASS)' is equivalent to
     'mv_is_TYPE_missing (var_get_missing_values (VAR), VALUE, CLASS)'.

   In addition, a few functions are provided to work more directly with
a variable's 'struct missing_values':

 -- Function: const struct missing_values * var_get_missing_values
          (const struct variable *VAR)
     Returns the 'struct missing_values' associated with VAR.  The
     caller must not modify the returned structure.  The return value is
     always non-null.

 -- Function: void var_set_missing_values (struct variable *VAR, const
          struct missing_values *MISS)
     Changes VAR's missing values to a copy of MISS, or if MISS is a
     null pointer, clears VAR's missing values.  If MISS is non-null, it
     must have the same width as VAR or be resizable to VAR's width
     (*note mv_resize::).  The caller retains ownership of MISS.

 -- Function: void var_clear_missing_values (struct variable *VAR)
     Clears VAR's missing values.  Equivalent to 'var_set_missing_values
     (VAR, NULL)'.

 -- Function: bool var_has_missing_values (const struct variable *VAR)
     Returns true if VAR has any missing values, false if it has none.
     Equivalent to 'mv_is_empty (var_get_missing_values (VAR))'.

2.5.4 Variable Value Labels
---------------------------

A numeric or short string variable may have a set of value labels (*note
(pspp)VALUE LABELS::), represented as a 'struct val_labs' (*note Value
Labels::).  The most commonly useful functions for value labels return
the value label associated with a value:

 -- Function: const char * var_lookup_value_label (const struct variable
          *VAR, const union value *VALUE)
     Looks for a label for VALUE in VAR's set of value labels.  VALUE
     must have the same width as VAR.  Returns the label if one exists,
     otherwise a null pointer.

 -- Function: void var_append_value_name (const struct variable *VAR,
          const union value *VALUE, struct string *STR)
     Looks for a label for VALUE in VAR's set of value labels.  VALUE
     must have the same width as VAR.  If a label exists, it will be
     appended to the string pointed to by STR.  Otherwise, it formats
     VALUE using VAR's print format (*note Input and Output Formats::)
     and appends the formatted string.

   The underlying 'struct val_labs' structure may also be accessed
directly using the functions described below.

 -- Function: bool var_has_value_labels (const struct variable *VAR)
     Returns true if VAR has at least one value label, false otherwise.

 -- Function: const struct val_labs * var_get_value_labels (const struct
          variable *VAR)
     Returns the 'struct val_labs' associated with VAR.  If VAR has no
     value labels, then the return value may or may not be a null
     pointer.

     The variable retains ownership of the returned 'struct val_labs',
     which the caller must not attempt to modify.

 -- Function: void var_set_value_labels (struct variable *VAR, const
          struct val_labs *VAL_LABS)
     Replaces VAR's value labels by a copy of VAL_LABS.  The caller
     retains ownership of VAL_LABS.  If VAL_LABS is a null pointer, then
     VAR's value labels, if any, are deleted.

 -- Function: void var_clear_value_labels (struct variable *VAR)
     Deletes VAR's value labels.  Equivalent to 'var_set_value_labels
     (VAR, NULL)'.

   A final group of functions offers shorthands for operations that
would otherwise require getting the value labels from a variable,
copying them, modifying them, and then setting the modified value labels
into the variable (making a second copy):

 -- Function: bool var_add_value_label (struct variable *VAR, const
          union value *VALUE, const char *LABEL)
     Attempts to add a copy of LABEL as a label for VALUE for the given
     VAR.  VALUE must have the same width as VAR.  If VALUE already has
     a label, then the old label is retained.  Returns true if a label
     is added, false if there was an existing label for VALUE.  Either
     way, the caller retains ownership of VALUE and LABEL.

 -- Function: void var_replace_value_label (struct variable *VAR, const
          union value *VALUE, const char *LABEL)
     Attempts to add a copy of LABEL as a label for VALUE for the given
     VAR.  VALUE must have the same width as VAR.  If VALUE already has
     a label, then LABEL replaces the old label.  Either way, the caller
     retains ownership of VALUE and LABEL.


File: pspp-dev.info,  Node: Variable Print and Write Formats,  Next: Variable Labels,  Prev: Variable Value Labels,  Up: Variables

2.5.5 Variable Print and Write Formats
--------------------------------------

Each variable has an associated pair of output formats, called its
"print format" and "write format".  *Note (pspp)Input and Output
Formats::, for an introduction to formats.  *Note Input and Output
Formats::, for a developer's description of format representation.

   The print format is used to convert a variable's data values to
strings for human-readable output.  The write format is used similarly
for machine-readable output, primarily by the WRITE transformation
(*note (pspp)WRITE::).  Most often a variable's print and write formats
are the same.

   A newly created variable by default has format F8.2 if it is numeric
or an A format with the same width as the variable if it is string.
Many creators of variables override these defaults.

   Both the print format and write format are output formats.  Input
formats are not part of 'struct variable'.  Instead, input programs and
transformations keep track of variable input formats themselves.

   The following functions work with variable print and write formats.

 -- Function: const struct fmt_spec * var_get_print_format (const struct
          variable *VAR)
 -- Function: const struct fmt_spec * var_get_write_format (const struct
          variable *VAR)
     Returns VAR's print or write format, respectively.

 -- Function: void var_set_print_format (struct variable *VAR, const
          struct fmt_spec *FORMAT)
 -- Function: void var_set_write_format (struct variable *VAR, const
          struct fmt_spec *FORMAT)
 -- Function: void var_set_both_formats (struct variable *VAR, const
          struct fmt_spec *FORMAT)
     Sets VAR's print format, write format, or both formats,
     respectively, to a copy of FORMAT.

2.5.6 Variable Labels
---------------------

A variable label is a string that describes a variable.  Variable labels
may contain spaces and punctuation not allowed in variable names.  *Note
(pspp)VARIABLE LABELS::, for a user-level description of variable
labels.

   The most commonly useful functions for variable labels are those to
retrieve a variable's label:

 -- Function: const char * var_to_string (const struct variable *VAR)
     Returns VAR's variable label, if it has one, otherwise VAR's name.
     In either case the caller must not attempt to modify or free the
     returned string.

     This function is useful for user output.

 -- Function: const char * var_get_label (const struct variable *VAR)
     Returns VAR's variable label, if it has one, or a null pointer
     otherwise.

   A few other variable label functions are also provided:

 -- Function: void var_set_label (struct variable *VAR, const char
          *LABEL)
     Sets VAR's variable label to a copy of LABEL, or removes any label
     from VAR if LABEL is a null pointer or contains only spaces.
     Leading and trailing spaces are removed from the variable label and
     its remaining content is truncated at 255 bytes.

 -- Function: void var_clear_label (struct variable *VAR)
     Removes any variable label from VAR.

 -- Function: bool var_has_label (const struct variable *VAR)
     Returns true if VAR has a variable label, false otherwise.

2.5.7 GUI Attributes
--------------------

These functions and types access and set attributes that are mainly used
by graphical user interfaces.  Their values are also stored in and
retrieved from system files (but not portable files).

   The first group of functions relate to the measurement level of
numeric data.  New variables are assigned a nominal level of measurement
by default.

 -- Enumeration: enum measure
     Measurement level.  Available values are:

     'MEASURE_NOMINAL'
          Numeric data values are arbitrary.  Arithmetic operations and
          numerical comparisons of such data are not meaningful.

     'MEASURE_ORDINAL'
          Numeric data values indicate progression along a rank order.
          Arbitrary arithmetic operations such as addition are not
          meaningful on such data, but inequality comparisons (less,
          greater, etc.)  have straightforward interpretations.

     'MEASURE_SCALE'
          Ratios, sums, etc.  of numeric data values have meaningful
          interpretations.

     PSPP does not have a separate category for interval data, which
     would naturally fall between the ordinal and scale measurement
     levels.

 -- Function: bool measure_is_valid (enum measure MEASURE)
     Returns true if MEASURE is a valid level of measurement, that is,
     if it is one of the 'enum measure' constants listed above, and
     false otherwise.

 -- Function: enum measure var_get_measure (const struct variable *VAR)
 -- Function: void var_set_measure (struct variable *VAR, enum measure
          MEASURE)
     Gets or sets VAR's measurement level.

   The following set of functions relates to the width of on-screen
columns used for displaying variable data in a graphical user interface
environment.  The unit of measurement is the width of a character.  For
proportionally spaced fonts, this is based on the average width of a
character.

 -- Function: int var_get_display_width (const struct variable *VAR)
 -- Function: void var_set_display_width (struct variable *VAR, int
          DISPLAY_WIDTH)
     Gets or sets VAR's display width.

 -- Function: int var_default_display_width (int WIDTH)
     Returns the default display width for a variable with the given
     WIDTH.  The default width of a numeric variable is 8.  The default
     width of a string variable is WIDTH or 32, whichever is less.

   The final group of functions work with the justification of data when
it is displayed in on-screen columns.  New variables are by default
right-justified.

 -- Enumeration: enum alignment
     Text justification.  Possible values are 'ALIGN_LEFT',
     'ALIGN_RIGHT', and 'ALIGN_CENTRE'.

 -- Function: bool alignment_is_valid (enum alignment ALIGNMENT)
     Returns true if ALIGNMENT is a valid alignment, that is, if it is
     one of the 'enum alignment' constants listed above, and false
     otherwise.

 -- Function: enum alignment var_get_alignment (const struct variable
          *VAR)
 -- Function: void var_set_alignment (struct variable *VAR, enum
          alignment ALIGNMENT)
     Gets or sets VAR's alignment.

2.5.8 Variable Leave Status
---------------------------

Commonly, most or all data in a case come from an input file, read with
a command such as DATA LIST or GET, but data can also be generated with
transformations such as COMPUTE. In the latter case the question of a
datum's "initial value" can arise.  For example, the value of a piece of
generated data can recursively depend on its own value:
     COMPUTE X = X + 1.
   Another situation where the initial value of a variable arises is
when its value is not set at all for some cases, e.g. below, 'Y' is set
only for the first 10 cases:
     DO IF #CASENUM <= 10.
     + COMPUTE Y = 1.
     END IF.

   By default, the initial value of a datum in either of these
situations is the system-missing value for numeric values and spaces for
string values.  This means that, above, X would be system-missing and
that Y would be 1 for the first 10 cases and system-missing for the
remainder.

   PSPP also supports retaining the value of a variable from one case to
another, using the LEAVE command (*note (pspp)LEAVE::).  The initial
value of such a variable is 0 if it is numeric and spaces if it is a
string.  If the command 'LEAVE X Y' is appended to the above example,
then X would have value 1 in the first case and increase by 1 in every
succeeding case, and Y would have value 1 for the first 10 cases and 0
for later cases.

   The LEAVE command has no effect on data that comes from an input file
or whose values do not depend on a variable's initial value.

   The value of scratch variables (*note (pspp)Scratch Variables::) are
always left from one case to another.

   The following functions work with a variable's leave status.

 -- Function: bool var_get_leave (const struct variable *VAR)
     Returns true if VAR's value is to be retained from case to case,
     false if it is reinitialized to system-missing or spaces.

 -- Function: void var_set_leave (struct variable *VAR, bool LEAVE)
     If LEAVE is true, marks VAR to be left from case to case; if LEAVE
     is false, marks VAR to be reinitialized for each case.

     If VAR is a scratch variable, LEAVE must be true.

 -- Function: bool var_must_leave (const struct variable *VAR)
     Returns true if VAR must be left from case to case, that is, if VAR
     is a scratch variable.


File: pspp-dev.info,  Node: Dictionary Class,  Next: Variable Creation and Destruction,  Prev: Variable Leave Status,  Up: Variables

2.5.9 Dictionary Class
----------------------

Occasionally it is useful to classify variables into "dictionary
classes" based on their names.  Dictionary classes are represented by
'enum dict_class'.  This type and other declarations for dictionary
classes are in the '<data/dict-class.h>' header.

 -- Enumeration: enum dict_class
     The dictionary classes are:

     'DC_ORDINARY'
          An ordinary variable, one whose name does not begin with '$'
          or '#'.

     'DC_SYSTEM'
          A system variable, one whose name begins with '$'.  *Note
          (pspp)System Variables::.

     'DC_SCRATCH'
          A scratch variable, one whose name begins with '#'.  *Note
          (pspp)Scratch Variables::.

     The values for dictionary classes are bitwise disjoint, which
     allows them to be used in bit-masks.  An extra enumeration constant
     'DC_ALL', whose value is the bitwise-or of all of the above
     constants, is provided to aid in this purpose.

   One example use of dictionary classes arises in connection with PSPP
syntax that uses 'A TO B' to name the variables in a dictionary from A
to B (*note (pspp)Sets of Variables::).  This syntax requires A and B to
be in the same dictionary class.  It limits the variables that it
includes to those in that dictionary class.

   The following functions relate to dictionary classes.

 -- Function: enum dict_class dict_class_from_id (const char *NAME)
     Returns the "dictionary class" for the given variable NAME, by
     looking at its first letter.

 -- Function: const char * dict_class_to_name (enum dict_class
          DICT_CLASS)
     Returns a name for the given DICT_CLASS as an adjective, e.g.
     '"scratch"'.

     This function should probably not be used in new code as it can
     lead to difficulties for internationalization.


File: pspp-dev.info,  Node: Variable Creation and Destruction,  Next: Variable Short Names,  Prev: Dictionary Class,  Up: Variables

2.5.10 Variable Creation and Destruction
----------------------------------------

Only rarely should PSPP code create or destroy variables directly.
Ordinarily, variables are created within a dictionary and destroying by
individual deletion from the dictionary or by destroying the entire
dictionary at once.  The functions here enable the exceptional case, of
creation and destruction of variables that are not associated with any
dictionary.  These functions are used internally in the dictionary
implementation.

 -- Function: struct variable * var_create (const char *NAME, int WIDTH)
     Creates and returns a new variable with the given NAME and WIDTH.
     The new variable is not part of any dictionary.  Use
     'dict_create_var', instead, to create a variable in a dictionary
     (*note Dictionary Creating Variables::).

     NAME should be a valid variable name and must be a "plausible"
     variable name (*note Variable Name::).  WIDTH must be between 0 and
     'MAX_STRING', inclusive (*note Values::).

     The new variable has no user-missing values, value labels, or
     variable label.  Numeric variables initially have F8.2 print and
     write formats, right-justified display alignment, and scale level
     of measurement.  String variables are created with A print and
     write formats, left-justified display alignment, and nominal level
     of measurement.  The initial display width is determined by
     'var_default_display_width' (*note var_default_display_width::).

     The new variable initially has no short name (*note Variable Short
     Names::) and no auxiliary data (*note Variable Auxiliary Data::).

 -- Function: struct variable * var_clone (const struct variable
          *OLD_VAR)
     Creates and returns a new variable with the same attributes as
     OLD_VAR, with a few exceptions.  First, the new variable is not
     part of any dictionary, regardless of whether OLD_VAR was in a
     dictionary.  Use 'dict_clone_var', instead, to add a clone of a
     variable to a dictionary.

     Second, the new variable is not given any short name, even if
     OLD_VAR had a short name.  This is because the new variable is
     likely to be immediately renamed, in which case the short name
     would be incorrect (*note Variable Short Names::).

     Finally, OLD_VAR's auxiliary data, if any, is not copied to the new
     variable (*note Variable Auxiliary Data::).

 -- Function: void var_destroy (struct variable *VAR)
     Destroys VAR and frees all associated storage, including its
     auxiliary data, if any.  VAR must not be part of a dictionary.  To
     delete a variable from a dictionary and destroy it, use
     'dict_delete_var' (*note Dictionary Deleting Variables::).


File: pspp-dev.info,  Node: Variable Short Names,  Next: Variable Relationships,  Prev: Variable Creation and Destruction,  Up: Variables

2.5.11 Variable Short Names
---------------------------

PSPP variable names may be up to 64 ('ID_MAX_LEN') bytes long.  The
system and portable file formats, however, were designed when variable
names were limited to 8 bytes in length.  Since then, the system file
format has been augmented with an extension record that explains how the
8-byte short names map to full-length names (*note Long Variable Names
Record::), but the short names are still present.  Thus, the continued
presence of the short names is more or less invisible to PSPP users, but
every variable in a system file still has a short name that must be
unique.

   PSPP can generate unique short names for variables based on their
full names at the time it creates the data file.  If all variables' full
names are unique in their first 8 bytes, then the short names are simply
prefixes of the full names; otherwise, PSPP changes them so that they
are unique.

   By itself this algorithm interoperates well with other software that
can read system files, as long as that software understands the
extension record that maps short names to long names.  When the other
software does not understand the extension record, it can produce
surprising results.  Consider a situation where PSPP reads a system file
that contains two variables named RANKINGSCORE, then the user adds a new
variable named RANKINGSTATUS, then saves the modified data as a new
system file.  A program that does not understand long names would then
see one of these variables under the name RANKINGS--either one,
depending on the algorithm's details--and the other under a different
name.  The effect could be very confusing: by adding a new and
apparently unrelated variable in PSPP, the user effectively renamed the
existing variable.

   To counteract this potential problem, every 'struct variable' may
have a short name.  A variable created by the system or portable file
reader receives the short name from that data file.  When a variable
with a short name is written to a system or portable file, that variable
receives priority over other long names whose names begin with the same
8 bytes but which were not read from a data file under that short name.

   Variables not created by the system or portable file reader have no
short name by default.

   A variable with a full name of 8 bytes or less in length has absolute
priority for that name when the variable is written to a system file,
even over a second variable with that assigned short name.

   PSPP does not enforce uniqueness of short names, although the short
names read from any given data file will always be unique.  If two
variables with the same short name are written to a single data file,
neither one receives priority.

   The following macros and functions relate to short names.

 -- Macro: SHORT_NAME_LEN
     Maximum length of a short name, in bytes.  Its value is 8.

 -- Function: const char * var_get_short_name (const struct variable
          *VAR)
     Returns VAR's short name, or a null pointer if VAR has not been
     assigned a short name.

 -- Function: void var_set_short_name (struct variable *VAR, const char
          *SHORT_NAME)
     Sets VAR's short name to SHORT_NAME, or removes VAR's short name if
     SHORT_NAME is a null pointer.  If it is non-null, then SHORT_NAME
     must be a plausible name for a variable.  The name will be
     truncated to 8 bytes in length and converted to all-uppercase.

 -- Function: void var_clear_short_name (struct variable *VAR)
     Removes VAR's short name.

2.5.12 Variable Relationships
-----------------------------

Variables have close relationships with dictionaries (*note
Dictionaries::) and cases (*note Cases::).  A variable is usually a
member of some dictionary, and a case is often used to store data for
the set of variables in a dictionary.

   These functions report on these relationships.  They may be applied
only to variables that are in a dictionary.

 -- Function: size_t var_get_dict_index (const struct variable *VAR)
     Returns VAR's index within its dictionary.  The first variable in a
     dictionary has index 0, the next variable index 1, and so on.

     The dictionary index can be influenced using dictionary functions
     such as dict_reorder_var (*note dict_reorder_var::).

 -- Function: size_t var_get_case_index (const struct variable *VAR)
     Returns VAR's index within a case.  The case index is an index into
     an array of 'union value' large enough to contain all the data in
     the dictionary.

     The returned case index can be used to access the value of VAR
     within a case for its dictionary, as in e.g. 'case_data_idx (case,
     var_get_case_index (VAR))', but ordinarily it is more convenient to
     use the data access functions that do variable-to-index translation
     internally, as in e.g. 'case_data (case, VAR)'.

2.5.13 Variable Auxiliary Data
------------------------------

Each 'struct variable' can have a single pointer to auxiliary data of
type 'void *'.  These functions manipulate a variable's auxiliary data.

   Use of auxiliary data is discouraged because of its lack of
flexibility.  Only one client can make use of auxiliary data on a given
variable at any time, even though many clients could usefully associate
data with a variable.

   To prevent multiple clients from attempting to use a variable's
single auxiliary data field at the same time, we adopt the convention
that use of auxiliary data in the active dataset dictionary is
restricted to the currently executing command.  In particular,
transformations must not attach auxiliary data to a variable in the
active dataset in the expectation that it can be used later when the
active dataset is read and the transformation is executed.  To help
enforce this restriction, auxiliary data is deleted from all variables
in the active dataset dictionary after the execution of each PSPP
command.

   This convention for safe use of auxiliary data applies only to the
active dataset dictionary.  Rules for other dictionaries may be
established separately.

   Auxiliary data should be replaced by a more flexible mechanism at
some point, but no replacement mechanism has been designed or
implemented so far.

   The following functions work with variable auxiliary data.

 -- Function: void * var_get_aux (const struct variable *VAR)
     Returns VAR's auxiliary data, or a null pointer if none has been
     assigned.

 -- Function: void * var_attach_aux (const struct variable *VAR, void
          *AUX, void (*AUX_DTOR) (struct variable *))
     Sets VAR's auxiliary data to AUX, which must not be null.  VAR must
     not already have auxiliary data.

     Before VAR's auxiliary data is cleared by 'var_clear_aux',
     AUX_DTOR, if non-null, will be called with VAR as its argument.  It
     should free any storage associated with AUX, if necessary.
     'var_dtor_free' may be appropriate for use as AUX_DTOR:

      -- Function: void var_dtor_free (struct variable *VAR)
          Frees VAR's auxiliary data by calling 'free'.

 -- Function: void var_clear_aux (struct variable *VAR)
     Removes auxiliary data, if any, from VAR, first calling the
     destructor passed to 'var_attach_aux', if one was provided.

     Use 'dict_clear_aux' to remove auxiliary data from every variable
     in a dictionary.

 -- Function: void * var_detach_aux (struct variable *VAR)
     Removes auxiliary data, if any, from VAR, and returns it.  Returns
     a null pointer if VAR had no auxiliary data.

     Any destructor passed to 'var_attach_aux' is not called, so the
     caller is responsible for freeing storage associated with the
     returned auxiliary data.


File: pspp-dev.info,  Node: Variable Categorical Values,  Prev: Variable Auxiliary Data,  Up: Variables

2.5.14 Variable Categorical Values
----------------------------------

Some statistical procedures require a list of all the values that a
categorical variable takes on.  Arranging such a list requires making a
pass through the data, so PSPP caches categorical values in 'struct
variable'.

   When variable auxiliary data is revamped to support multiple clients
as described in the previous section, categorical values are an obvious
candidate.  The form in which they are currently supported is inelegant.

   Categorical values are not robust against changes in the data.  That
is, there is currently no way to detect that a transformation has
changed data values, meaning that categorical values lists for the
changed variables must be recomputed.  PSPP is in fact in need of a
general-purpose caching and cache-invalidation mechanism, but none has
yet been designed and built.

   The following functions work with cached categorical values.

 -- Function: struct cat_vals * var_get_obs_vals (const struct variable
          *VAR)
     Returns VAR's set of categorical values.  Yields undefined behavior
     if VAR does not have any categorical values.

 -- Function: void var_set_obs_vals (const struct variable *VAR, struct
          cat_vals *CAT_VALS)
     Destroys VAR's categorical values, if any, and replaces them by
     CAT_VALS, ownership of which is transferred to VAR.  If CAT_VALS is
     a null pointer, then VAR's categorical values are cleared.

 -- Function: bool var_has_obs_vals (const struct variable *VAR)
     Returns true if VAR has a set of categorical values, false
     otherwise.

2.6 Dictionaries
================

Each data file in memory or on disk has an associated dictionary, whose
primary purpose is to describe the data in the file.  *Note
(pspp)Variables::, for a PSPP user's view of a dictionary.

   A data file stored in a PSPP format, either as a system or portable
file, has a representation of its dictionary embedded in it.  Other
kinds of data files are usually not self-describing enough to construct
a dictionary unassisted, so the dictionaries for these files must be
specified explicitly with PSPP commands such as DATA LIST.

   The most important content of a dictionary is an array of variables,
which must have unique names.  A dictionary also conceptually contains a
mapping from each of its variables to a location within a case (*note
Cases::), although in fact these mappings are stored within individual
variables.

   System variables are not members of any dictionary (*note
(pspp)System Variables::).

   Dictionaries are represented by 'struct dictionary'.  Declarations
related to dictionaries are in the '<data/dictionary.h>' header.

   The following sections describe functions for use with dictionaries.

File: pspp-dev.info,  Node: Dictionary Variable Access,  Next: Dictionary Creating Variables,  Up: Dictionaries

2.6.1 Accessing Variables
-------------------------

The most common operations on a dictionary simply retrieve a 'struct
variable *' of an individual variable based on its name or position.

 -- Function: struct variable * dict_lookup_var (const struct dictionary
          *DICT, const char *NAME)
 -- Function: struct variable * dict_lookup_var_assert (const struct
          dictionary *DICT, const char *NAME)
     Looks up and returns the variable with the given NAME within DICT.
     Name lookup is not case-sensitive.

     'dict_lookup_var' returns a null pointer if DICT does not contain a
     variable named NAME.  'dict_lookup_var_assert' asserts that such a
     variable exists.

 -- Function: struct variable * dict_get_var (const struct dictionary
          *DICT, size_t POSITION)
     Returns the variable at the given POSITION in DICT.  POSITION must
     be less than the number of variables in DICT (see below).

 -- Function: size_t dict_get_var_cnt (const struct dictionary *DICT)
     Returns the number of variables in DICT.

   Another pair of functions allows retrieving a number of variables at
once.  These functions are more rarely useful.

 -- Function: void dict_get_vars (const struct dictionary *DICT, const
          struct variable ***VARS, size_t *CNT, enum dict_class EXCLUDE)
 -- Function: void dict_get_vars_mutable (const struct dictionary *DICT,
          struct variable ***VARS, size_t *CNT, enum dict_class EXCLUDE)
     Retrieves all of the variables in DICT, in their original order,
     except that any variables in the dictionary classes specified
     EXCLUDE, if any, are excluded (*note Dictionary Class::).  Pointers
     to the variables are stored in an array allocated with 'malloc',
     and a pointer to the first element of this array is stored in
     '*VARS'.  The caller is responsible for freeing this memory when it
     is no longer needed.  The number of variables retrieved is stored
     in '*CNT'.

     The presence or absence of 'DC_SYSTEM' in EXCLUDE has no effect,
     because dictionaries never include system variables.

   One additional function is available.  This function is most often
used in assertions, but it is not restricted to such use.

 -- Function: bool dict_contains_var (const struct dictionary *DICT,
          const struct variable *VAR)
     Tests whether VAR is one of the variables in DICT.  Returns true if
     so, false otherwise.


File: pspp-dev.info,  Node: Dictionary Creating Variables,  Next: Dictionary Deleting Variables,  Prev: Dictionary Variable Access,  Up: Dictionaries

2.6.2 Creating Variables
------------------------

These functions create a new variable and insert it into a dictionary in
a single step.

   There is no provision for inserting an already created variable into
a dictionary.  There is no reason that such a function could not be
written, but so far there has been no need for one.

   The names provided to one of these functions should be valid variable
names and must be plausible variable names.

   If a variable with the same name already exists in the dictionary,
the non-'assert' variants of these functions return a null pointer,
without modifying the dictionary.  The 'assert' variants, on the other
hand, assert that no duplicate name exists.

   A variable may be in only one dictionary at any given time.

 -- Function: struct variable * dict_create_var (struct dictionary
          *DICT, const char *NAME, int WIDTH)
 -- Function: struct variable * dict_create_var_assert (struct
          dictionary *DICT, const char *NAME, int WIDTH)
     Creates a new variable with the given NAME and WIDTH, as if through
     a call to 'var_create' with those arguments (*note var_create::),
     appends the new variable to DICT's array of variables, and returns
     the new variable.

 -- Function: struct variable * dict_clone_var (struct dictionary *DICT,
          const struct variable *OLD_VAR)
 -- Function: struct variable * dict_clone_var_assert (struct dictionary
          *DICT, const struct variable *OLD_VAR)
     Creates a new variable as a clone of VAR, inserts the new variable
     into DICT, and returns the new variable.  Other properties of the
     new variable are copied from OLD_VAR, except for those not copied
     by 'var_clone' (*note var_clone::).

     VAR does not need to be a member of any dictionary.

 -- Function: struct variable * dict_clone_var_as (struct dictionary
          *DICT, const struct variable *OLD_VAR, const char *NAME)
 -- Function: struct variable * dict_clone_var_as_assert (struct
          dictionary *DICT, const struct variable *OLD_VAR, const char
          *NAME)
     These functions are similar to 'dict_clone_var' and
     'dict_clone_var_assert', respectively, except that the new variable
     is named NAME instead of keeping OLD_VAR's name.


File: pspp-dev.info,  Node: Dictionary Deleting Variables,  Next: Dictionary Reordering Variables,  Prev: Dictionary Creating Variables,  Up: Dictionaries

2.6.3 Deleting Variables
------------------------

These functions remove variables from a dictionary's array of variables.
They also destroy the removed variables and free their associated
storage.

   Deleting a variable to which there might be external pointers is a
bad idea.  In particular, deleting variables from the active dataset
dictionary is a risky proposition, because transformations can retain
references to arbitrary variables.  Therefore, no variable should be
deleted from the active dataset dictionary when any transformations are
active, because those transformations might reference the variable to be
deleted.  The safest time to delete a variable is just after a procedure
has been executed, as done by DELETE VARIABLES.

   Deleting a variable automatically removes references to that variable
from elsewhere in the dictionary as a weighting variable, filter
variable, SPLIT FILE variable, or member of a vector.

   No functions are provided for removing a variable from a dictionary
without destroying that variable.  As with insertion of an existing
variable, there is no reason that this could not be implemented, but so
far there has been no need.

 -- Function: void dict_delete_var (struct dictionary *DICT, struct
          variable *VAR)
     Deletes VAR from DICT, of which it must be a member.

 -- Function: void dict_delete_vars (struct dictionary *DICT, struct
          variable *const *VARS, size_t COUNT)
     Deletes the COUNT variables in array VARS from DICT.  All of the
     variables in VARS must be members of DICT.  No variable may be
     included in VARS more than once.

 -- Function: void dict_delete_consecutive_vars (struct dictionary
          *DICT, size_t IDX, size_t COUNT)
     Deletes the variables in sequential positions IDX...IDX + COUNT
     (exclusive) from DICT, which must contain at least IDX + COUNT
     variables.

 -- Function: void dict_delete_scratch_vars (struct dictionary *DICT)
     Deletes all scratch variables from DICT.

2.6.4 Changing Variable Order
-----------------------------

The variables in a dictionary are stored in an array.  These functions
change the order of a dictionary's array of variables without changing
which variables are in the dictionary.

 -- Function: void dict_reorder_var (struct dictionary *DICT, struct
          variable *VAR, size_t NEW_INDEX)
     Moves VAR, which must be in DICT, so that it is at position
     NEW_INDEX in DICT's array of variables.  Other variables in DICT,
     if any, retain their relative positions.  NEW_INDEX must be less
     than the number of variables in DICT.

 -- Function: void dict_reorder_vars (struct dictionary *DICT, struct
          variable *const *NEW_ORDER, size_t COUNT)
     Moves the COUNT variables in NEW_ORDER to the beginning of DICT's
     array of variables in the specified order.  Other variables in
     DICT, if any, retain their relative positions.

     All of the variables in NEW_ORDER must be in DICT.  No duplicates
     are allowed within NEW_ORDER, which means that COUNT must be no
     greater than the number of variables in DICT.


File: pspp-dev.info,  Node: Dictionary Renaming Variables,  Next: Dictionary Weight Variable,  Prev: Dictionary Reordering Variables,  Up: Dictionaries

2.6.5 Renaming Variables
------------------------

These functions change the names of variables within a dictionary.  The
'var_set_name' function (*note var_set_name::) cannot be applied
directly to a variable that is in a dictionary, because 'struct
dictionary' contains an index by name that 'var_set_name' would not
update.  The following functions take care to update the index as well.
They also ensure that variable renaming does not cause a dictionary to
contain a duplicate variable name.

 -- Function: void dict_rename_var (struct dictionary *DICT, struct
          variable *VAR, const char *NEW_NAME)
     Changes the name of VAR, which must be in DICT, to NEW_NAME.  A
     variable named NEW_NAME must not already be in DICT, unless
     NEW_NAME is the same as VAR's current name.

 -- Function: bool dict_rename_vars (struct dictionary *DICT, struct
          variable **VARS, char **NEW_NAMES, size_t COUNT, char
          **ERR_NAME)
     Renames each of the COUNT variables in VARS to the name in the
     corresponding position of NEW_NAMES.  If the renaming would result
     in a duplicate variable name, returns false and stores one of the
     names that would be be duplicated into '*ERR_NAME', if ERR_NAME is
     non-null.  Otherwise, the renaming is successful, and true is
     returned.


File: pspp-dev.info,  Node: Dictionary Weight Variable,  Next: Dictionary Filter Variable,  Prev: Dictionary Renaming Variables,  Up: Dictionaries

2.6.6 Weight Variable
---------------------

A data set's cases may optionally be weighted by the value of a numeric
variable.  *Note (pspp)WEIGHT::, for a user view of weight variables.

   The weight variable is written to and read from system and portable
files.

   The most commonly useful function related to weighting is a
convenience function to retrieve a weighting value from a case.

 -- Function: double dict_get_case_weight (const struct dictionary
          *DICT, const struct ccase *CASE, bool *WARN_ON_INVALID)
     Retrieves and returns the value of the weighting variable specified
     by DICT from CASE.  Returns 1.0 if DICT has no weighting variable.

     Returns 0.0 if C's weight value is user- or system-missing, zero,
     or negative.  In such a case, if WARN_ON_INVALID is non-null and
     '*WARN_ON_INVALID' is true, 'dict_get_case_weight' also issues an
     error message and sets '*WARN_ON_INVALID' to false.  To disable
     error reporting, pass a null pointer or a pointer to false as
     WARN_ON_INVALID or use a 'msg_disable'/'msg_enable' pair.

   The dictionary also has a pair of functions for getting and setting
the weight variable.

 -- Function: struct variable * dict_get_weight (const struct dictionary
          *DICT)
     Returns DICT's current weighting variable, or a null pointer if the
     dictionary does not have a weighting variable.

 -- Function: void dict_set_weight (struct dictionary *DICT, struct
          variable *VAR)
     Sets DICT's weighting variable to VAR.  If VAR is non-null, it must
     be a numeric variable in DICT.  If VAR is null, then DICT's
     weighting variable, if any, is cleared.


File: pspp-dev.info,  Node: Dictionary Filter Variable,  Next: Dictionary Case Limit,  Prev: Dictionary Weight Variable,  Up: Dictionaries

2.6.7 Filter Variable
---------------------

When the active dataset is read by a procedure, cases can be excluded
from analysis based on the values of a "filter variable".  *Note
(pspp)FILTER::, for a user view of filtering.

   These functions store and retrieve the filter variable.  They are
rarely useful, because the data analysis framework automatically
excludes from analysis the cases that should be filtered.

 -- Function: struct variable * dict_get_filter (const struct dictionary
          *DICT)
     Returns DICT's current filter variable, or a null pointer if the
     dictionary does not have a filter variable.

 -- Function: void dict_set_filter (struct dictionary *DICT, struct
          variable *VAR)
     Sets DICT's filter variable to VAR.  If VAR is non-null, it must be
     a numeric variable in DICT.  If VAR is null, then DICT's filter
     variable, if any, is cleared.


File: pspp-dev.info,  Node: Dictionary Case Limit,  Next: Dictionary Split Variables,  Prev: Dictionary Filter Variable,  Up: Dictionaries

2.6.8 Case Limit
----------------

The limit on cases analyzed by a procedure, set by the N OF CASES
command (*note (pspp)N OF CASES::), is stored as part of the dictionary.
The dictionary does not, on the other hand, play any role in enforcing
the case limit (a job done by data analysis framework code).

   A case limit of 0 means that the number of cases is not limited.

   These functions are rarely useful, because the data analysis
framework automatically excludes from analysis any cases beyond the
limit.

 -- Function: casenumber dict_get_case_limit (const struct dictionary
          *DICT)
     Returns the current case limit for DICT.

 -- Function: void dict_set_case_limit (struct dictionary *DICT,
          casenumber LIMIT)
     Sets DICT's case limit to LIMIT.


File: pspp-dev.info,  Node: Dictionary Split Variables,  Next: Dictionary File Label,  Prev: Dictionary Case Limit,  Up: Dictionaries

2.6.9 Split Variables
---------------------

The user may use the SPLIT FILE command (*note (pspp)SPLIT FILE::) to
select a set of variables on which to split the active dataset into
groups of cases to be analyzed independently in each statistical
procedure.  The set of split variables is stored as part of the
dictionary, although the effect on data analysis is implemented by each
individual statistical procedure.

   Split variables may be numeric or short or long string variables.

   The most useful functions for split variables are those to retrieve
them.  Even these functions are rarely useful directly: for the purpose
of breaking cases into groups based on the values of the split
variables, it is usually easier to use 'casegrouper_create_splits'.

 -- Function: const struct variable *const * dict_get_split_vars (const
          struct dictionary *DICT)
     Returns a pointer to an array of pointers to split variables.  If
     and only if there are no split variables, returns a null pointer.
     The caller must not modify or free the returned array.

 -- Function: size_t dict_get_split_cnt (const struct dictionary *DICT)
     Returns the number of split variables.

   The following functions are also available for working with split
variables.

 -- Function: void dict_set_split_vars (struct dictionary *DICT, struct
          variable *const *VARS, size_t CNT)
     Sets DICT's split variables to the CNT variables in VARS.  If CNT
     is 0, then DICT will not have any split variables.  The caller
     retains ownership of VARS.

 -- Function: void dict_unset_split_var (struct dictionary *DICT, struct
          variable *VAR)
     Removes VAR, which must be a variable in DICT, from DICT's split of
     split variables.

2.6.10 File Label
-----------------

A dictionary may optionally have an associated string that describes its
contents, called its file label.  The user may set the file label with
the FILE LABEL command (*note (pspp)FILE LABEL::).

   These functions set and retrieve the file label.

 -- Function: const char * dict_get_label (const struct dictionary
          *DICT)
     Returns DICT's file label.  If DICT does not have a label, returns
     a null pointer.

 -- Function: void dict_set_label (struct dictionary *DICT, const char
          *LABEL)
     Sets DICT's label to LABEL.  If LABEL is non-null, then its
     content, truncated to at most 60 bytes, becomes the new file label.
     If LABEL is null, then DICT's label is removed.

     The caller retains ownership of LABEL.


File: pspp-dev.info,  Node: Dictionary Documents,  Prev: Dictionary File Label,  Up: Dictionaries

2.6.11 Documents
----------------

A dictionary may include an arbitrary number of lines of explanatory
text, called the dictionary's documents.  For compatibility, document
lines have a fixed width, and lines that are not exactly this width are
truncated or padded with spaces as necessary to bring them to the
correct width.

   PSPP users can use the DOCUMENT (*note (pspp)DOCUMENT::), ADD
DOCUMENT (*note (pspp)ADD DOCUMENT::), and DROP DOCUMENTS (*note
(pspp)DROP DOCUMENTS::) commands to manipulate documents.

 -- Macro: int DOC_LINE_LENGTH
     The fixed length of a document line, in bytes, defined to 80.

   The following functions work with whole sets of documents.  They
accept or return sets of documents formatted as null-terminated strings
that are an exact multiple of 'DOC_LINE_LENGTH' bytes in length.

 -- Function: const char * dict_get_documents (const struct dictionary
          *DICT)
     Returns the documents in DICT, or a null pointer if DICT has no
     documents.

 -- Function: void dict_set_documents (struct dictionary *DICT, const
          char *NEW_DOCUMENTS)
     Sets DICT's documents to NEW_DOCUMENTS.  If NEW_DOCUMENTS is a null
     pointer or an empty string, then DICT's documents are cleared.  The
     caller retains ownership of NEW_DOCUMENTS.

 -- Function: void dict_clear_documents (struct dictionary *DICT)
     Clears the documents from DICT.

   The following functions work with individual lines in a dictionary's
set of documents.

 -- Function: void dict_add_document_line (struct dictionary *DICT,
          const char *CONTENT)
     Appends CONTENT to the documents in DICT.  The text in CONTENT will
     be truncated or padded with spaces as necessary to make it exactly
     'DOC_LINE_LENGTH' bytes long.  The caller retains ownership of
     CONTENT.

     If CONTENT is over 'DOC_LINE_LENGTH', this function also issues a
     warning using 'msg'.  To suppress the warning, enclose a call to
     one of this function in a 'msg_disable'/'msg_enable' pair.

 -- Function: size_t dict_get_document_line_cnt (const struct dictionary
          *DICT)
     Returns the number of line of documents in DICT.  If the dictionary
     contains no documents, returns 0.

 -- Function: void dict_get_document_line (const struct dictionary
          *DICT, size_t IDX, struct string *CONTENT)
     Replaces the text in CONTENT (which must already have been
     initialized by the caller) by the document line in DICT numbered
     IDX, which must be less than the number of lines of documents in
     DICT.  Any trailing white space in the document line is trimmed, so
     that CONTENT will have a length between 0 and 'DOC_LINE_LENGTH'.

6 Internationalisation
**********************

Internationalisation in pspp is complicated.  The most annoying aspect
is that of character-encoding.  This chapter attempts to describe the
problems and current ways in which they are addressed.

6.1 The working locales
=======================

Pspp has three "working" locales:

   * The locale of the user interface.
   * The locale of the output.
   * The locale of the data.  Only the character encoding is relevant.

   Each of these locales may, at different times take separate (or
identical) values.  So for example, a French statistician can use pspp
to prepare a report in the English language, using a datafile which has
been created by a Japanese researcher hence uses a Japanese character
set.

   It's rarely, if ever, necessary to interrogate the system to find out
the values of the 3 locales.  However it's important to be aware of the
source (destination) locale when reading (writing) string data.  When
transfering data between a source and a destination, the appropriate
recoding must be performed.

6.1.1 The user interface locale
-------------------------------

This is the locale which is visible to the person using pspp.  Error
messages and confidence indications are written in this locale.  For
example "Cannot open file" will be written in the user interface locale.

   This locale is set from the environment of the user who starts
pspp{ire} or from the system locale if not set.

6.1.2 The output locale
-----------------------

This locale is the one that should be visible to the person reading a
report generated by pspp.  Non-data related strings (Eg: "Page number",
"Standard Deviation" etc.)  will appear in this locale.

6.1.3 The data locale
---------------------

This locale is the one associated with the data being analysed with
pspp.  The only important aspect of this locale is the character
encoding.  (1) The dictionary pertaining to the data contains a field
denoting the encoding.  Any string data stored in a 'union value' will
be encoded in the dictionary's character set.

6.2 System files
================

'*.sav' files contain a field which is supposed to identify the encoding
of the data they contain (*note Machine Integer Info Record::).
However, many files produced by early versions of spss set this to "2"
(ASCII) regardless of the encoding of the data.  Later versions contain
an additional record (*note Character Encoding Record::) describing the
encoding.  When a system file is read, the dictionary's encoding is set
using information gleened from the system file.  If the encoding cannot
be determined or would be unreliable, then it remains unset.

6.3 GUI
=======

The psppire graphic user interface is written using the Gtk+ api, for
which all strings must be encoded in UTF8.  All strings passed to the
GTK+/GLib library functions (except for filenames) must be UTF-8 encoded
otherwise errors will occur.  Thus, for the purposes of the programming
psppire, the user interface locale should be assumed to be UTF8, even if
setlocale and/or nl_langinfo indicates otherwise.

6.3.1 Filenames
---------------

The GLib API has some special functions for dealing with filenames.
Strings returned from functions like gtk_file_chooser_dialog_get_name
are not, in general, encoded in UTF8, but in "filename" encoding.  If
that filename is passed to another GLib function which expects a
filename, no conversion is necessary.  If it's passed to a function for
the purposes of displaying it (eg.  in a window's title-bar) it must be
converted to UTF8 -- there is a special function for this:
g_filename_display_name or g_filename_basename.  If however, a filename
needs to be passed outside of GTK+/GLib (for example to fopen) it must
be converted to the local system encoding.

6.4 Existing locale handling functions
======================================

The major aspect of locale handling which the programmer has to consider
is that of character encoding.

   The following function is used to recode strings:

 -- Function: char * recode_string (const char *TO, const char *FROM,
          const char *TEXT, int LEN);

     Converts the string TEXT, which is encoded in FROM to a new string
     encoded in TO encoding.  If LEN is not -1, then it must be the
     number of bytes in TEXT.  It is the caller's responsibility to free
     the returned string when no longer required.

   In order to minimise the number of conversions required, and to
simplify design, PSPP attempts to store all internal strings in UTF8
encoding.  Thus, when reading system and portable files (or any other
data source), the following items are immediately converted to UTF8
encoding:
   * Variable names
   * Variable labels
   * Value labels
   Conversely, when writing system files, these are converted back to
the encoding of that system file.

   String data stored in union values are left in their original
encoding.  These will be converted by the data_in/data_out functions.

6.5 Quirks
==========

For historical reasons, not all locale handling follows posix
conventions.  This makes it difficult (impossible?)  to elegantly handle
the issues.  For example, it would make sense for the gui's datasheet to
display numbers formatted according to the LC_NUMERIC category of the
data locale.  Instead however there is the 'data_out' function (*note
Obtaining Properties of Format Types::) which uses the
'settings_get_decimal_char' function instead of the decimal separator of
the locale.  Similarly, formatting of monetary values is displayed in a
pspp/spss specific fashion instead of using the LC_MONETARY category.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) It might also be desirable for the LC_COLLATE category to be used
for the purposes of sorting data.

Appendix A Portable File Format
*******************************

These days, most computers use the same internal data formats for
integer and floating-point data, if one ignores little differences like
big- versus little-endian byte ordering.  However, occasionally it is
necessary to exchange data between systems with incompatible data
formats.  This is what portable files are designed to do.

   *Please note:* This information is gleaned from examination of
ASCII-formatted portable files only, so some of it may be incorrect for
portable files formatted in EBCDIC or other character sets.

A.1 Portable File Characters
============================

Portable files are arranged as a series of lines of 80 characters each.
Each line is terminated by a carriage-return, line-feed sequence
("new-lines").  New-lines are only used to avoid line length limits
imposed by some OSes; they are not meaningful.

   Most lines in portable files are exactly 80 characters long.  The
only exception is a line that ends in one or more spaces, in which the
spaces may optionally be omitted.  Thus, a portable file reader must act
as though a line shorter than 80 characters is padded to that length
with spaces.

   The file must be terminated with a 'Z' character.  In addition, if
the final line in the file does not have exactly 80 characters, then it
is padded on the right with 'Z' characters.  (The file contents may be
in any character set; the file contains a description of its own
character set, as explained in the next section.  Therefore, the 'Z'
character is not necessarily an ASCII 'Z'.)

   For the rest of the description of the portable file format,
new-lines and the trailing 'Z's will be ignored, as if they did not
exist, because they are not an important part of understanding the file
contents.

A.2 Portable File Structure
===========================

Every portable file consists of the following records, in sequence:

   * File header.

   * Version and date info.

   * Product identification.

   * Author identification (optional).

   * Subproduct identification (optional).

   * Variable count.

   * Case weight variable (optional).

   * Variables.  Each variable record may optionally be followed by a
     missing value record and a variable label record.

   * Value labels (optional).

   * Documents (optional).

   * Data.

   Most records are identified by a single-character tag code.  The file
header and version info record do not have a tag.

   Other than these single-character codes, there are three types of
fields in a portable file: floating-point, integer, and string.
Floating-point fields have the following format:

   * Zero or more leading spaces.

   * Optional asterisk ('*'), which indicates a missing value.  The
     asterisk must be followed by a single character, generally a period
     ('.'), but it appears that other characters may also be possible.
     This completes the specification of a missing value.

   * Optional minus sign ('-') to indicate a negative number.

   * A whole number, consisting of one or more base-30 digits: '0'
     through '9' plus capital letters 'A' through 'T'.

   * Optional fraction, consisting of a radix point ('.') followed by
     one or more base-30 digits.

   * Optional exponent, consisting of a plus or minus sign ('+' or '-')
     followed by one or more base-30 digits.

   * A forward slash ('/').

   Integer fields take a form identical to floating-point fields, but
they may not contain a fraction.

   String fields take the form of a integer field having value N,
followed by exactly N characters, which are the string content.

A.3 Portable File Header
========================

Every portable file begins with a 464-byte header, consisting of a
200-byte collection of vanity splash strings, followed by a 256-byte
character set translation table, followed by an 8-byte tag string.

   The 200-byte segment is divided into five 40-byte sections, each of
which represents the string 'CHARSET SPSS PORT FILE' in a different
character set encoding, where CHARSET is the name of the character set
used in the file, e.g. 'ASCII' or 'EBCDIC'.  Each string is padded on
the right with spaces in its respective character set.

   It appears that these strings exist only to inform those who might
view the file on a screen, and that they are not parsed by SPSS
products.  Thus, they can be safely ignored.  For those interested, the
strings are supposed to be in the following character sets, in the
specified order: EBCDIC, 7-bit ASCII, CDC 6-bit ASCII, 6-bit ASCII,
Honeywell 6-bit ASCII.

   The 256-byte segment describes a mapping from the character set used
in the portable file to an arbitrary character set having characters at
the following positions:

0-60

     Control characters.  Not important enough to describe in full here.

61-63

     Reserved.

64-73

     Digits '0' through '9'.

74-99

     Capital letters 'A' through 'Z'.

100-125

     Lowercase letters 'a' through 'z'.

126

     Space.

127-130

     Symbols '.<(+'

131

     Solid vertical pipe.

132-142

     Symbols '&[]!$*);^-/'

143

     Broken vertical pipe.

144-150

     Symbols ',%_>'?'`:'

151

     British pound symbol.

152-155

     Symbols '@'="'.

156

     Less than or equal symbol.

157

     Empty box.

158

     Plus or minus.

159

     Filled box.

160

     Degree symbol.

161

     Dagger.

162

     Symbol '~'.

163

     En dash.

164

     Lower left corner box draw.

165

     Upper left corner box draw.

166

     Greater than or equal symbol.

167-176

     Superscript '0' through '9'.

177

     Lower right corner box draw.

178

     Upper right corner box draw.

179

     Not equal symbol.

180

     Em dash.

181

     Superscript '('.

182

     Superscript ')'.

183

     Horizontal dagger (?).

184-186

     Symbols '{}\'.
187

     Cents symbol.

188

     Centered dot, or bullet.

189-255

     Reserved.

   Symbols that are not defined in a particular character set are set to
the same value as symbol 64; i.e., to '0'.

   The 8-byte tag string consists of the exact characters 'SPSSPORT' in
the portable file's character set, which can be used to verify that the
file is indeed a portable file.

     A represents version 0, and so on.

   * An 8-character string field giving the file creation date in the
     format YYYYMMDD.

A.8 Case Weight Variable Record
===============================

The case weight variable record is optional.  If it is present, it
indicates the variable used for weighting cases; if it is absent, cases
are unweighted.  It has tag code '6'.  It consists of a single string
field that names the weighting variable.


File: pspp-dev.info,  Node: Variable Records,  Next: Value Label Records,  Prev: Case Weight Variable Record,  Up: Portable File Format

A.9 Variable Records
====================

Each variable record represents a single variable.  Variable records
have tag code '7'.  They have the following structure:

   * Width (integer).  This is 0 for a numeric variable, and a number
     between 1 and 255 for a string variable.

   * Name (string).  1-8 characters long.  Must be in all capitals.

     A few portable files that contain duplicate variable names have
     been spotted in the wild.  PSPP handles these by renaming the
     duplicates with numeric extensions: 'VAR_1', 'VAR_2', and so on.

   * Print format.  This is a set of three integer fields:

        - Format type (*note Variable Record::).

        - Format width.  1-40.

        - Number of decimal places.  1-40.

     A few portable files with invalid format types or formats that are
     not of the appropriate width for their variables have been spotted
     in the wild.  PSPP assigns a default F or A format to a variable
     with an invalid format.

   * Write format.  Same structure as the print format described above.

   Each variable record can optionally be followed by a missing value
record, which has tag code '8'.  A missing value record has one field,
the missing value itself (a floating-point or string, as appropriate).
Up to three of these missing value records can be used.

   There is also a record for missing value ranges, which has tag code
'B'.  It is followed by two fields representing the range, which are
floating-point or string as appropriate.  If a missing value range is
present, it may be followed by a single missing value record.

   Tag codes '9' and 'A' represent 'LO THRU X' and 'X THRU HI' ranges,
respectively.  Each is followed by a single field representing X.  If
one of the ranges is present, it may be followed by a single missing
value record.

   In addition, each variable record can optionally be followed by a
variable label record, which has tag code 'C'.  A variable label record
has one field, the variable label itself (string).


File: pspp-dev.info,  Node: Value Label Records,  Next: Portable File Document Record,  Prev: Variable Records,  Up: Portable File Format

A.10 Value Label Records
========================

Value label records have tag code 'D'.  They have the following format:

   * Variable count (integer).

   * List of variables (strings).  The variable count specifies the
     number in the list.  Variables are specified by their names.  All
     variables must be of the same type (numeric or string), but string
     variables do not necessarily have the same width.

   * Label count (integer).

   * List of (value, label) tuples.  The label count specifies the
     number of tuples.  Each tuple consists of a value, which is numeric
     or string as appropriate to the variables, followed by a label
     (string).

   A few portable files that specify duplicate value labels, that is,
two different labels for a single value of a single variable, have been
spotted in the wild.  PSPP uses the last value label specified in these
cases.


File: pspp-dev.info,  Node: Portable File Document Record,  Next: Portable File Data,  Prev: Value Label Records,  Up: Portable File Format

A.11 Document Record
====================

One document record may optionally follow the value label record.  The
document record consists of tag code 'E', following by the number of
document lines as an integer, followed by that number of strings, each
of which represents one document line.  Document lines must be 80 bytes
long or shorter.


File: pspp-dev.info,  Node: Portable File Data,  Prev: Portable File Document Record,  Up: Portable File Format

A.12 Portable File Data
=======================

The data record has tag code 'F'.  There is only one tag for all the
data; thus, all the data must follow the dictionary.  The data is
terminated by the end-of-file marker 'Z', which is not valid as the
beginning of a data element.

   Data elements are output in the same order as the variable records
describing them.  String variables are output as string fields, and
numeric variables are output as floating-point fields.

Appendix B System File Format
*****************************

A system file encapsulates a set of cases and dictionary information
that describes how they may be interpreted.  This chapter describes the
format of a system file.

   System files use four data types: 8-bit characters, 32-bit integers,
64-bit integers, and 64-bit floating points, called here 'char',
'int32', 'int64', and 'flt64', respectively.  Data is not necessarily
aligned on a word or double-word boundary: the long variable name record
(*note Long Variable Names Record::) and very long string records (*note
Very Long String Record::) have arbitrary byte length and can therefore
cause all data coming after them in the file to be misaligned.

   Integer data in system files may be big-endian or little-endian.  A
reader may detect the endianness of a system file by examining
'layout_code' in the file header record (*note 'layout_code':
layout_code.).

   Floating-point data in system files may nominally be in IEEE 754,
IBM, or VAX formats.  A reader may detect the floating-point format in
use by examining 'bias' in the file header record (*note 'bias': bias.).

   PSPP detects big-endian and little-endian integer formats in system
files and translates as necessary.  PSPP also detects the floating-point
format in use, as well as the endianness of IEEE 754 floating-point
numbers, and translates as needed.  However, only IEEE 754 numbers with
the same endianness as integer data in the same file have actually been
observed in system files, and it is likely that other formats are
obsolete or were never used.

   System files use a few floating point values for special purposes:

SYSMIS
     The system-missing value is represented by the largest possible
     negative number in the floating point format ('-DBL_MAX').

HIGHEST
     HIGHEST is used as the high end of a missing value range with an
     unbounded maximum.  It is represented by the largest possible
     positive number ('DBL_MAX').

LOWEST
     LOWEST is used as the low end of a missing value range with an
     unbounded minimum.  It was originally represented by the
     second-largest negative number (in IEEE 754 format,
     '0xffeffffffffffffe').  System files written by SPSS 21 and later
     instead use the largest negative number ('-DBL_MAX'), the same
     value as SYSMIS. This does not lead to ambiguity because LOWEST
     appears in system files only in missing value ranges, which never
     contain SYSMIS.

   System files may use most character encodings based on an 8-bit unit.
UTF-16 and UTF-32, based on wider units, appear to be unacceptable.
'rec_type' in the file header record is sufficient to distinguish
between ASCII and EBCDIC based encodings.  The best way to determine the
specific encoding in use is to consult the character encoding record
(*note Character Encoding Record::), if present, and failing that the
'character_code' in the machine integer info record (*note Machine
Integer Info Record::).  The same encoding should be used for the
dictionary and the data in the file, although it is possible to
artificially synthesize files that use different encodings (*note
Character Encoding Record::).

B.1 System File Record Structure
================================

System files are divided into records with the following format:

     int32               type;
     char                data[];

   This header does not identify the length of the 'data' or any
information about what it contains, so the system file reader must
understand the format of 'data' based on 'type'.  However, records with
type 7, called "extension records", have a stricter format:

     int32               type;
     int32               subtype;
     int32               size;
     int32               count;
     char                data[size * count];

'int32 rec_type;'
     Record type.  Always set to 7.

'int32 subtype;'
     Record subtype.  This value identifies a particular kind of
     extension record.

'int32 size;'
     The size of each piece of data that follows the header, in bytes.
     Known extension records use 1, 4, or 8, for 'char', 'int32', and
     'flt64' format data, respectively.

'int32 count;'
     The number of pieces of data that follow the header.

'char data[size * count];'
     Data, whose format and interpretation depend on the subtype.

   An extension record contains exactly 'size * count' bytes of data,
which allows a reader that does not understand an extension record to
skip it.  Extension records provide only nonessential information, so
this allows for files written by newer software to preserve backward
compatibility with older or less capable readers.

   Records in a system file must appear in the following order:

   * File header record.

   * Variable records.

   * All pairs of value labels records and value label variables
     records, if present.

   * Document record, if present.

   * Extension (type 7) records, in ascending numerical order of their
     subtypes.

     System files written by SPSS include at most one of each kind of
     extension record.  This is generally true of system files written
     by other software as well, with known exceptions noted below in the
     individual sections about each type of record.

   * Dictionary termination record.

   * Data record.

   We advise authors of programs that read system files to tolerate
format variations.  Various kinds of misformatting and corruption have
been observed in system files written by SPSS and other software alike.
In particular, because extension records provide nonessential
information, it is generally better to ignore an extension record
entirely than to refuse to read a system file.

   The following sections describe the known kinds of records.


File: pspp-dev.info,  Node: File Header Record,  Next: Variable Record,  Prev: System File Record Structure,  Up: System File Format

B.2 File Header Record
======================

A system file begins with the file header, with the following format:

     char                rec_type[4];
     char                prod_name[60];
     int32               layout_code;
     int32               nominal_case_size;
     int32               compression;
     int32               weight_index;
     int32               ncases;
     flt64               bias;
     char                creation_date[9];
     char                creation_time[8];
     char                file_label[64];
     char                padding[3];

'char rec_type[4];'
     Record type code, either '$FL2' for system files with uncompressed
     data or data compressed with simple bytecode compression, or '$FL3'
     for system files with ZLIB compressed data.

     This is truly a character field that uses the character encoding as
     other strings.  Thus, in a file with an ASCII-based character
     encoding this field contains '24 46 4c 32' or '24 46 4c 33', and in
     a file with an EBCDIC-based encoding this field contains '5b c6 d3
     f2'.  (No EBCDIC-based ZLIB-compressed files have been observed.)

'char prod_name[60];'
     Product identification string.  This always begins with the
     characters '@(#) SPSS DATA FILE'.  PSPP uses the remaining
     characters to give its version and the operating system name; for
     example, 'GNU pspp 0.1.4 - sparc-sun-solaris2.5.2'.  The string is
     truncated if it would be longer than 60 characters; otherwise it is
     padded on the right with spaces.

'int32 layout_code;'
     Normally set to 2, although a few system files have been spotted in
     the wild with a value of 3 here.  PSPP use this value to determine
     the file's integer endianness (*note System File Format::).

'int32 nominal_case_size;'
     Number of data elements per case.  This is the number of variables,
     except that long string variables add extra data elements (one for
     every 8 characters after the first 8).  However, string variables
     do not contribute to this value beyond the first 255 bytes.
     Further, system files written by some systems set this value to -1.
     In general, it is unsafe for systems reading system files to rely
     upon this value.

'int32 compression;'
     Set to 0 if the data in the file is not compressed, 1 if the data
     is compressed with simple bytecode compression, 2 if the data is
     ZLIB compressed.  This field has value 2 if and only if 'rec_type'
     is '$FL3'.

'int32 weight_index;'
     If one of the variables in the data set is used as a weighting
     variable, set to the dictionary index of that variable, plus 1
     (*note Dictionary Index::).  Otherwise, set to 0.

'int32 ncases;'
     Set to the number of cases in the file if it is known, or -1
     otherwise.

     In the general case it is not possible to determine the number of
     cases that will be output to a system file at the time that the
     header is written.  The way that this is dealt with is by writing
     the entire system file, including the header, then seeking back to
     the beginning of the file and writing just the 'ncases' field.  For
     files in which this is not valid, the seek operation fails.  In
     this case, 'ncases' remains -1.

'flt64 bias;'
     Compression bias, ordinarily set to 100.  Only integers between '1
     - bias' and '251 - bias' can be compressed.

     By assuming that its value is 100, PSPP uses 'bias' to determine
     the file's floating-point format and endianness (*note System File
     Format::).  If the compression bias is not 100, PSPP cannot
     auto-detect the floating-point format and assumes that it is IEEE
     754 format with the same endianness as the system file's integers,
     which is correct for all known system files.

'char creation_date[9];'
     Date of creation of the system file, in 'dd mmm yy' format, with
     the month as standard English abbreviations, using an initial
     capital letter and following with lowercase.  If the date is not
     available then this field is arbitrarily set to '01 Jan 70'.

'char creation_time[8];'
     Time of creation of the system file, in 'hh:mm:ss' format and using
     24-hour time.  If the time is not available then this field is
     arbitrarily set to '00:00:00'.

'char file_label[64];'
     File label declared by the user, if any (*note (pspp)FILE LABEL::).
     Padded on the right with spaces.

     A product that identifies itself as 'VOXCO INTERVIEWER 4.3' uses
     CR-only line ends in this field, rather than the more usual LF-only
     or CR LF line ends.

'char padding[3];'
     Ignored padding bytes to make the structure a multiple of 32 bits
     in length.  Set to zeros.


File: pspp-dev.info,  Node: Variable Record,  Next: Value Labels Records,  Prev: File Header Record,  Up: System File Format

B.3 Variable Record
===================

There must be one variable record for each numeric variable and each
string variable with width 8 bytes or less.  String variables wider than
8 bytes have one variable record for each 8 bytes, rounding up.  The
first variable record for a long string specifies the variable's correct
dictionary information.  Subsequent variable records for a long string
are filled with dummy information: a type of -1, no variable label or
missing values, print and write formats that are ignored, and an empty
string as name.  A few system files have been encountered that include a
variable label on dummy variable records, so readers should take care to
parse dummy variable records in the same way as other variable records.

   The "dictionary index" of a variable is its offset in the set of
variable records, including dummy variable records for long string
variables.  The first variable record has a dictionary index of 0, the
second has a dictionary index of 1, and so on.

   The system file format does not directly support string variables
wider than 255 bytes.  Such very long string variables are represented
by a number of narrower string variables.  *Note Very Long String
Record::, for details.

   A system file should contain at least one variable and thus at least
one variable record, but system files have been observed in the wild
without any variables (thus, no data either).

     int32               rec_type;
     int32               type;
     int32               has_var_label;
     int32               n_missing_values;
     int32               print;
     int32               write;
     char                name[8];

     /* Present only if 'has_var_label' is 1. */
     int32               label_len;
     char                label[];

     /* Present only if 'n_missing_values' is nonzero. */
     flt64               missing_values[];

'int32 rec_type;'
     Record type code.  Always set to 2.

'int32 type;'
     Variable type code.  Set to 0 for a numeric variable.  For a short
     string variable or the first part of a long string variable, this
     is set to the width of the string.  For the second and subsequent
     parts of a long string variable, set to -1, and the remaining
     fields in the structure are ignored.

'int32 has_var_label;'
     If this variable has a variable label, set to 1; otherwise, set to
     0.

'int32 n_missing_values;'
     If the variable has no missing values, set to 0.  If the variable
     has one, two, or three discrete missing values, set to 1, 2, or 3,
     respectively.  If the variable has a range for missing variables,
     set to -2; if the variable has a range for missing variables plus a
     single discrete value, set to -3.

     A long string variable always has the value 0 here.  A separate
     record indicates missing values for long string variables (*note
     Long String Missing Values Record::).

'int32 print;'
     Print format for this variable.  See below.

'int32 write;'
     Write format for this variable.  See below.

'char name[8];'
     Variable name.  The variable name must begin with a capital letter
     or the at-sign ('@').  Subsequent characters may also be digits,
     octothorpes ('#'), dollar signs ('$'), underscores ('_'), or full
     stops ('.').  The variable name is padded on the right with spaces.

     The 'name' fields should be unique within a system file.  System
     files written by SPSS that contain very long string variables with
     similar names sometimes contain duplicate names that are later
     eliminated by resolving the very long string names (*note Very Long
     String Record::).  PSPP handles duplicates by assigning them new,
     unique names.

'int32 label_len;'
     This field is present only if 'has_var_label' is set to 1.  It is
     set to the length, in characters, of the variable label.  The
     documented maximum length varies from 120 to 255 based on SPSS
     version, but some files have been seen with longer labels.  PSPP
     accepts labels of any length.

'char label[];'
     This field is present only if 'has_var_label' is set to 1.  It has
     length 'label_len', rounded up to the nearest multiple of 32 bits.
     The first 'label_len' characters are the variable's variable label.

'flt64 missing_values[];'
     This field is present only if 'n_missing_values' is nonzero.  It
     has the same number of 8-byte elements as the absolute value of
     'n_missing_values'.  Each element is interpreted as a number for
     numeric variables (with HIGHEST and LOWEST indicated as described
     in the chapter introduction).  For string variables of width less
     than 8 bytes, elements are right-padded with spaces; for string
     variables wider than 8 bytes, only the first 8 bytes of each
     missing value are specified, with the remainder implicitly all
     spaces.

     For discrete missing values, each element represents one missing
     value.  When a range is present, the first element denotes the
     minimum value in the range, and the second element denotes the
     maximum value in the range.  When a range plus a value are present,
     the third element denotes the additional discrete missing value.

   The 'print' and 'write' members of sysfile_variable are output
formats coded into 'int32' types.  The least-significant byte of the
'int32' represents the number of decimal places, and the next two bytes
in order of increasing significance represent field width and format
type, respectively.  The most-significant byte is not used and should be
set to zero.

   Format types are defined as follows:

     1       'A'

     38      'EDATE'
     39      'SDATE'

   A few system files have been observed in the wild with invalid
'write' fields, in particular with value 0.  Readers should probably
treat invalid 'print' or 'write' fields as some default format.

B.4 Value Labels Records
========================

The value label records documented in this section are used for numeric
and short string variables only.  Long string variables may have value
labels, but their value labels are recorded using a different record
type (*note Long String Value Labels Record::).

   The value label record has the following format:

     int32               rec_type;
     int32               label_count;

     /* Repeated 'label_cnt' times. */
     char                value[8];
     char                label_len;
     char                label[];

'int32 rec_type;'
     Record type.  Always set to 3.

'int32 label_count;'
     Number of value labels present in this record.

   The remaining fields are repeated 'count' times.  Each repetition
specifies one value label.

'char value[8];'
     A numeric value or a short string value padded as necessary to 8
     bytes in length.  Its type and width cannot be determined until the
     following value label variables record (see below) is read.

'char label_len;'
     The label's length, in bytes.  The documented maximum length varies
     from 60 to 120 based on SPSS version.  PSPP supports value labels
     up to 255 bytes long.

'char label[];'
     'label_len' bytes of the actual label, followed by up to 7 bytes of
     padding to bring 'label' and 'label_len' together to a multiple of
     8 bytes in length.

   The value label record is always immediately followed by a value
label variables record with the following format:

     int32               rec_type;
     int32               var_count;
     int32               vars[];

'int32 rec_type;'
     Record type.  Always set to 4.

'int32 var_count;'
     Number of variables that the associated value labels from the value
     label record are to be applied.

'int32 vars[];'
     A list of dictionary indexes of variables to which to apply the
     value labels (*note Dictionary Index::).  There are 'var_count'
     elements.

     String variables wider than 8 bytes may not be specified in this
     list.

     char                lines[][80];

'int32 rec_type;'
     Record type.  Always set to 6.

'int32 n_lines;'
     Number of lines of documents present.

'char lines[][80];'
     Document lines.  The number of elements is defined by 'n_lines'.
     Lines shorter than 80 characters are padded on the right with
     spaces.

     Size of each piece of data in the data part, in bytes.  Always set
     to 4.

'int32 count;'
     Number of pieces of data in the data part.  Always set to 8.

'int32 version_major;'
     PSPP major version number.  In version X.Y.Z, this is X.

     Machine code.  PSPP always set this field to value to -1, but other
     values may appear.

'int32 floating_point_rep;'
     Floating point representation code.  For IEEE 754 systems this is
     1.  IBM 370 sets this to 2, and DEC VAX E to 3.

'int32 compression_code;'
     Compression code.  Always set to 1, regardless of whether or how
     the file is compressed.

'int32 endianness;'
     Machine endianness.  1 indicates big-endian, 2 indicates
     little-endian.

'int32 character_code;'
     Character code.  The following values have been actually observed
     in system files:

     1
          EBCDIC.

     2
          7-bit ASCII.

     1250
          The 'windows-1250' code page for Central European and Eastern
          European languages.

          UTF-8.

     The following additional values are known to be defined:

     3
          8-bit "ASCII".

     4
          DEC Kanji.

     Other Windows code page numbers are known to be generally valid.

     Old versions of SPSS for Unix and Windows always wrote value 2 in
     this field, regardless of the encoding in use.  Newer versions also
     write the character encoding as a string (see *note Character
     Encoding Record::).

     The SPSSWriter library in PHP, which identifies itself as 'FOM SPSS
     1.0.0' in the file header record 'prod_name' field, writes
     unexpected values to these fields, but it uses the same values
     consistently throughout the rest of the file.


File: pspp-dev.info,  Node: Multiple Response Sets Records,  Next: Extra Product Info Record,  Prev: Machine Floating-Point Info Record,  Up: System File Format

B.8 Multiple Response Sets Records
==================================

The system file format has two different types of records that represent
multiple response sets (*note (pspp)MRSETS::).  The first type of record
describes multiple response sets that can be understood by SPSS before
version 14.  The second type of record, with a closely related format,
is used for multiple dichotomy sets that use the
CATEGORYLABELS=COUNTEDVALUES feature added in version 14.

     /* Header. */
     int32               rec_type;
     int32               subtype;
     int32               size;
     int32               count;

     /* Exactly 'count' bytes of data. */
     char                mrsets[];

'int32 rec_type;'
     Record type.  Always set to 7.

'int32 subtype;'
     Record subtype.  Set to 7 for records that describe multiple
     response sets understood by SPSS before version 14, or to 19 for
     records that describe dichotomy sets that use the
     CATEGORYLABELS=COUNTEDVALUES feature added in version 14.

'int32 size;'
     The size of each element in the 'mrsets' member.  Always set to 1.

'int32 count;'
     The total number of bytes in 'mrsets'.

'char mrsets[];'
     Zero or more line feeds (byte 0x0a), followed by a series of
     multiple response sets, each of which consists of the following:

        * The set's name (an identifier that begins with '$'), in mixed
          upper and lower case.

        * An equals sign ('=').

        * 'C' for a multiple category set, 'D' for a multiple dichotomy
          set with CATEGORYLABELS=VARLABELS, or 'E' for a multiple
          dichotomy set with CATEGORYLABELS=COUNTEDVALUES.

        * For a multiple dichotomy set with
          CATEGORYLABELS=COUNTEDVALUES, a space, followed by a number
          expressed as decimal digits, followed by a space.  If
          LABELSOURCE=VARLABEL was specified on MRSETS, then the number
          is 11; otherwise it is 1.(1)

        * For either kind of multiple dichotomy set, the counted value,
          as a positive integer count specified as decimal digits,
          followed by a space, followed by as many string bytes as
          specified in the count.  If the set contains numeric
          variables, the string consists of the counted integer value
          expressed as decimal digits.  If the set contains string
          variables, the string contains the counted string value.
          Either way, the string may be padded on the right with spaces
          (older versions of SPSS seem to always pad to a width of 8
          bytes; newer versions don't).

        * A space.

        * The multiple response set's label, using the same format as
          for the counted value for multiple dichotomy sets.  A string
          of length 0 means that the set does not have a label.  A
          string of length 0 is also written if LABELSOURCE=VARLABEL was
          specified.

        * A space.

        * The short names of the variables in the set, converted to
          lowercase, each separated from the previous by a single space.

          Even though a multiple response set must have at least two
          variables, some system files contain multiple response sets
          with no variables or one variable.  The source and meaning of
          these multiple response sets is unknown.  (Perhaps they arise
          from creating a multiple response set then deleting all the
          variables that it contains?)

        * One line feed (byte 0x0a).  Sometimes multiple, even hundreds,
          of line feeds are present.

   Example: Given appropriate variable definitions, consider the
following MRSETS command:

     MRSETS /MCGROUP NAME=$a LABEL='my mcgroup' VARIABLES=a b c
            /MDGROUP NAME=$b VARIABLES=g e f d VALUE=55
            /MDGROUP NAME=$c LABEL='mdgroup #2' VARIABLES=h i j VALUE='Yes'
            /MDGROUP NAME=$d LABEL='third mdgroup' CATEGORYLABELS=COUNTEDVALUES
             VARIABLES=k l m VALUE=34
            /MDGROUP NAME=$e CATEGORYLABELS=COUNTEDVALUES LABELSOURCE=VARLABEL
             VARIABLES=n o p VALUE='choice'.

   The above would generate the following multiple response set record
of subtype 7:

     $a=C 10 my mcgroup a b c
     $b=D2 55 0  g e f d
     $c=D3 Yes 10 mdgroup #2 h i j

   It would also generate the following multiple response set record
with subtype 19:

     $d=E 1 2 34 13 third mdgroup k l m
     $e=E 11 6 choice 0  n o p

a single example of each possibility has been examined.

'int32 size;'
     The size of each element in the 'info' member.  Always set to 1.

'int32 count;'
     The total number of bytes in 'info'.

'char info[];'
     A text string.  A product that identifies itself as 'VOXCO
     INTERVIEWER 4.3' uses CR-only line ends in this field, rather than
     the more usual LF-only or CR LF line ends.

B.10 Variable Display Parameter Record
======================================

The variable display parameter record, if present, has the following
format:

     /* Header. */
     int32               rec_type;
     int32               subtype;
     int32               size;
     int32               count;

     /* Repeated 'count' times. */
     int32               measure;
     int32               width;           /* Not always present. */
     int32               alignment;

'int32 rec_type;'
     Record type.  Always set to 7.

'int32 subtype;'
     Record subtype.  Always set to 11.

'int32 size;'
     The size of 'int32'.  Always set to 4.

'int32 count;'
     The number of sets of variable display parameters (ordinarily the
     number of variables in the dictionary), times 2 or 3.

   The remaining members are repeated 'count' times, in the same order
as the variable records.  No element corresponds to variable records
that continue long string variables.  The meanings of these members are
as follows:

'int32 measure;'
     The measurement type of the variable:
     1
          Nominal Scale
     2
          Ordinal Scale
     3
          Continuous Scale

     SPSS sometimes writes a 'measure' of 0.  PSPP interprets this as
     nominal scale.

'int32 width;'
     The width of the display column for the variable in characters.

     This field is present if COUNT is 3 times the number of variables
     in the dictionary.  It is omitted if COUNT is 2 times the number of
     variables.

'int32 alignment;'
     The alignment of the variable for display purposes:

     0
          Left aligned
     1
          Right aligned
     2
          Centre aligned

     int32               size;
     int32               count;

     /* Exactly 'count' bytes of data. */
     char                var_name_pairs[];

'int32 rec_type;'
     Record type.  Always set to 7.

'int32 subtype;'
     Record subtype.  Always set to 13.

'int32 size;'
     The size of each element in the 'var_name_pairs' member.  Always
     set to 1.

'int32 count;'
     The total number of bytes in 'var_name_pairs'.

'char var_name_pairs[];'
     A list of KEY-VALUE tuples, where KEY is the name of a variable,
     and VALUE is its long variable name.  The KEY field is at most 8
     bytes long and must match the name of a variable which appears in
     the variable record (*note Variable Record::).  The VALUE field is
     at most 64 bytes long.  The KEY and VALUE fields are separated by a
     '=' byte.  Each tuple is separated by a byte whose value is 09.
     There is no trailing separator following the last tuple.  The total
     length is 'count' bytes.


File: pspp-dev.info,  Node: Very Long String Record,  Next: Character Encoding Record,  Prev: Long Variable Names Record,  Up: System File Format

B.12 Very Long String Record
============================

Old versions of SPSS limited string variables to a width of 255 bytes.
For backward compatibility with these older versions, the system file
format represents a string longer than 255 bytes, called a "very long
string", as a collection of strings no longer than 255 bytes each.  The
strings concatenated to make a very long string are called its
"segments"; for consistency, variables other than very long strings are
considered to have a single segment.

   A very long string with a width of W has N = (W + 251) / 252
segments, that is, one segment for every 252 bytes of width, rounding
up.  It would be logical, then, for each of the segments except the last
to have a width of 252 and the last segment to have the remainder, but
this is not the case.  In fact, each segment except the last has a width
of 255 bytes.  The last segment has width W - (N - 1) * 252; some
versions of SPSS make it slightly wider, but not wide enough to make the
last segment require another 8 bytes of data.

   Data is packed tightly into segments of a very long string, 255 bytes
per segment.  Because 255 bytes of segment data are allocated for every
252 bytes of the very long string's width (approximately), some unused
space is left over at the end of the allocated segments.  Data in unused
space is ignored.

   Example: Consider a very long string of width 20,000.  Such a very
long string has 20,000 / 252 = 80 (rounding up) segments.  The first 79
segments have width 255; the last segment has width 20,000 - 79 * 252 =
92 or slightly wider (up to 96 bytes, the next multiple of 8).  The very
long string's data is actually stored in the 19,890 bytes in the first
78 segments, plus the first 110 bytes of the 79th segment (19,890 + 110
= 20,000).  The remaining 145 bytes of the 79th segment and all 92 bytes
of the 80th segment are unused.

   The very long string record explains how to stitch together segments
to obtain very long string data.  For each of the very long string
variables in the dictionary, it specifies the name of its first
segment's variable and the very long string variable's actual width.
The remaining segments immediately follow the named variable in the
system file's dictionary.

   The very long string record, which is present only if the system file
contains very long string variables, has the following format:

     /* Header. */
     int32               rec_type;
     int32               subtype;
     int32               size;
     int32               count;

     /* Exactly 'count' bytes of data. */
     char                string_lengths[];

'int32 rec_type;'
     Record type.  Always set to 7.

'int32 subtype;'
     Record subtype.  Always set to 14.

'int32 size;'
     The size of each element in the 'string_lengths' member.  Always
     set to 1.

'int32 count;'
     The total number of bytes in 'string_lengths'.

'char string_lengths[];'
     A list of KEY-VALUE tuples, where KEY is the name of a variable,
     and VALUE is its length.  The KEY field is at most 8 bytes long and
     must match the name of a variable which appears in the variable
     record (*note Variable Record::).  The VALUE field is exactly 5
     bytes long.  It is a zero-padded, ASCII-encoded string that is the
     length of the variable.  The KEY and VALUE fields are separated by
     a '=' byte.  Tuples are delimited by a two-byte sequence {00, 09}.
     After the last tuple, there may be a single byte 00, or {00, 09}.
     The total length is 'count' bytes.

B.13 Character Encoding Record
==============================

This record, if present, indicates the character encoding for string
data, long variable names, variable labels, value labels and other
strings in the file.

     /* Header. */
     int32               rec_type;
     int32               subtype;
     int32               size;
     int32               count;

     /* Exactly 'count' bytes of data. */
     char                encoding[];

'int32 rec_type;'
     Record type.  Always set to 7.

'int32 subtype;'
     Record subtype.  Always set to 20.

'int32 size;'
     The size of each element in the 'encoding' member.  Always set to
     1.

'int32 count;'
     The total number of bytes in 'encoding'.

'char encoding[];'
     The name of the character encoding.  Normally this will be an
     official IANA character set name or alias.  See
     <http://www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets>.  Character set
     names are not case-sensitive, but SPSS appears to write them in
     all-uppercase.

   This record is not present in files generated by older software.  See
also the 'character_code' field in the machine integer info record
(*note character-code::).

   When the character encoding record and the machine integer info
record are both present, all system files observed in practice indicate
the same character encoding, e.g. 1252 as 'character_code' and
'windows-1252' as 'encoding', 65001 and 'UTF-8', etc.

   If, for testing purposes, a file is crafted with different
'character_code' and 'encoding', it seems that 'character_code' controls
the encoding for all strings in the system file before the dictionary
termination record, including strings in data (e.g. string missing
values), and 'encoding' controls the encoding for strings following the
dictionary termination record.

'char var_name[];'
     The number of bytes in the name of the variable that has long
     string value labels, plus the variable name itself, which consists
     of exactly 'var_name_len' bytes.  The variable name is not padded
     to any particular boundary, nor is it null-terminated.

'int32 var_width;'
     The width of the variable, in bytes, which will be between 9 and
     32767.

'int32 n_labels;'
'long_string_label labels[];'
     The long string labels themselves.  The 'labels' array contains
     exactly 'n_labels' elements, each of which has the following
     substructure:

          int32               value_len;
          char                value[];
          int32               label_len;
          char                label[];

     'int32 value_len;'
     'char value[];'
          The string value being labeled.  'value_len' is the number of
          bytes in 'value'; it is equal to 'var_width'.  The 'value'
          array is not padded or null-terminated.

     'int32 label_len;'
     'char label[];'
          The label for the string value.  'label_len', which must be
          between 0 and 120, is the number of bytes in 'label'.  The
          'label' array is not padded or null-terminated.

B.15 Long String Missing Values Record
======================================

This record, if present, specifies missing values for long string
variables.

     /* Header. */
     int32               rec_type;
     int32               subtype;
     int32               size;
     int32               count;

     /* Repeated up to exactly 'count' bytes. */
     int32               var_name_len;
     char                var_name[];
     char                n_missing_values;
     long_string_missing_value   values[];

'int32 rec_type;'
     Record type.  Always set to 7.

'int32 subtype;'
     Record subtype.  Always set to 22.

'int32 size;'
     Always set to 1.

'int32 count;'
     The number of bytes following the header until the next header.

'int32 var_name_len;'
'char var_name[];'
     The number of bytes in the name of the long string variable that
     has missing values, plus the variable name itself, which consists
     of exactly 'var_name_len' bytes.  The variable name is not padded
     to any particular boundary, nor is it null-terminated.

'char n_missing_values;'
     The number of missing values, either 1, 2, or 3.  (This is,
     unusually, a single byte instead of a 32-bit number.)

'long_string_missing_value values[];'
     The missing values themselves.  This array contains exactly
     'n_missing_values' elements, each of which has the following
     substructure:

          int32               value_len;
          char                value[];

     'int32 value_len;'
          The length of the missing value string, in bytes.  This value
          should be 8, because long string variables are at least 8
          bytes wide (by definition), only the first 8 bytes of a long
          string variable's missing values are allowed to be non-spaces,
          and any spaces within the first 8 bytes are included in the
          missing value here.

     'char value[];'
          The missing value string, exactly 'value_len' bytes, without
          any padding or null terminator.

B.16 Data File and Variable Attributes Records
==============================================

The data file and variable attributes records represent custom
attributes for the system file or for individual variables in the system
file, as defined on the DATAFILE ATTRIBUTE (*note (pspp)DATAFILE
ATTRIBUTE::) and VARIABLE ATTRIBUTE commands (*note (pspp)VARIABLE
ATTRIBUTE::), respectively.

     /* Header. */
     int32               rec_type;
     int32               subtype;
     int32               size;
     int32               count;

     /* Exactly 'count' bytes of data. */
     char                attributes[];

'int32 rec_type;'
     Record type.  Always set to 7.

'int32 subtype;'
     Record subtype.  Always set to 17 for a data file attribute record
     or to 18 for a variable attributes record.

'int32 size;'
     The size of each element in the 'attributes' member.  Always set to
     1.

'int32 count;'
     The total number of bytes in 'attributes'.

'char attributes[];'
     The attributes, in a text-based format.

     In record subtype 17, this field contains a single attribute set.
     An attribute set is a sequence of one or more attributes
     concatenated together.  Each attribute consists of a name, which
     has the same syntax as a variable name, followed by, inside
     parentheses, a sequence of one or more values.  Each value consists
     of a string enclosed in single quotes (''') followed by a line feed
     (byte 0x0a).  A value may contain single quote characters, which
     are not themselves escaped or quoted or required to be present in
     pairs.  There is no apparent way to embed a line feed in a value.
     There is no distinction between an attribute with a single value
     and an attribute array with one element.

     In record subtype 18, this field contains a sequence of one or more
     variable attribute sets.  If more than one variable attribute set
     is present, each one after the first is delimited from the previous
     by '/'.  Each variable attribute set consists of a long variable
     name, followed by ':', followed by an attribute set with the same
     syntax as on record subtype 17.

     System files written by 'Stata 14.1/-savespss- 1.77 by S.Radyakin'
     may include multiple records with subtype 18, one per variable that
     has variable attributes.

     The total length is 'count' bytes.

Example
-------

A system file produced with the following VARIABLE ATTRIBUTE commands in
effect:

     VARIABLE ATTRIBUTE VARIABLES=dummy ATTRIBUTE=fred[1]('23') fred[2]('34').
     VARIABLE ATTRIBUTE VARIABLES=dummy ATTRIBUTE=bert('123').

will contain a variable attribute record with the following contents:

     0000  07 00 00 00 12 00 00 00  01 00 00 00 22 00 00 00  |............"...|

B.16.1 Variable Roles
---------------------

A variable's role is represented as an attribute named '$@Role'.  This
attribute has a single element whose values and their meanings are:

'0'
     Input.  This, the default, is the most common role.
'1'
     Output.
'2'
     Both.
'3'
     None.
'4'

B.17 Extended Number of Cases Record
====================================

The file header record expresses the number of cases in the system file
as an int32 (*note File Header Record::).  This record allows the number
of cases in the system file to be expressed as a 64-bit number.

     int32               rec_type;
     int32               subtype;
     int32               size;
     int32               count;
     int64               unknown;
     int64               ncases64;

'int32 rec_type;'
     Record type.  Always set to 7.

'int32 subtype;'
     Record subtype.  Always set to 16.

'int32 size;'
     Size of each element.  Always set to 8.

'int32 count;'
     Number of pieces of data in the data part.  Alway set to 2.

'int64 unknown;'
     Meaning unknown.  Always set to 1.

'int64 ncases64;'
     Number of cases in the file as a 64-bit integer.  Presumably this
     could be -1 to indicate that the number of cases is unknown, for
     the same reason as 'ncases' in the file header record, but this has
     not been observed in the wild.

B.18 Other Informational Records
================================

This chapter documents many specific types of extension records are
documented here, but others are known to exist.  PSPP ignores unknown
extension records when reading system files.

   The following extension record subtypes have also been observed, with
the following believed meanings:

5
     A set of grouped variables (according to Aapi Ha"ma"la"inen).

6
     Date info, probably related to USE (according to Aapi
     Ha"ma"la"inen).

12
     A UUID in the format described in RFC 4122.  Only two examples
     observed, both written by SPSS 13, and in each case the UUID
     contained both upper and lower case.

24
     XML that describes how data in the file should be displayed
     on-screen.


File: pspp-dev.info,  Node: Dictionary Termination Record,  Next: Data Record,  Prev: Other Informational Records,  Up: System File Format

B.19 Dictionary Termination Record
==================================

The dictionary termination record separates all other records from the
data records.

     int32               rec_type;
     int32               filler;

'int32 rec_type;'
     Record type.  Always set to 999.

'int32 filler;'
     Ignored padding.  Should be set to 0.


File: pspp-dev.info,  Node: Data Record,  Prev: Dictionary Termination Record,  Up: System File Format

B.20 Data Record
================

The data record must follow all other records in the system file.  Every
system file must have a data record that specifies data for at least one
case.  The format of the data record varies depending on the value of
'compression' in the file header record:

0: no compression
     Data is arranged as a series of 8-byte elements.  Each element
     corresponds to the variable declared in the respective variable
     record (*note Variable Record::).  Numeric values are given in
     'flt64' format; string values are literal characters string, padded
     on the right when necessary to fill out 8-byte units.

1: bytecode compression
     The first 8 bytes of the data record is divided into a series of
     1-byte command codes.  These codes have meanings as described
     below:

     0
          Ignored.  If the program writing the system file accumulates
          compressed data in blocks of fixed length, 0 bytes can be used
          to pad out extra bytes remaining at the end of a fixed-size
          block.

     1 through 251
          A number with value CODE - BIAS, where CODE is the value of
          the compression code and BIAS is the variable 'bias' from the
          file header.  For example, code 105 with bias 100.0 (the
          normal value) indicates a numeric variable of value 5.  One
          file has been seen written by SPSS 14 that contained such a
          code in a _string_ field with the value 0 (after the bias is
          subtracted) as a way of encoding null bytes.

     252
          End of file.  This code may or may not appear at the end of
          the data stream.  PSPP always outputs this code but its use is
          not required.

     253
          A numeric or string value that is not compressible.  The value
          is stored in the 8 bytes following the current block of
          command bytes.  If this value appears twice in a block of
          command bytes, then it indicates the second group of 8 bytes
          following the command bytes, and so on.

     254
          An 8-byte string value that is all spaces.

     255
          The system-missing value.

     The end of the 8-byte group of bytecodes is followed by any 8-byte
     blocks of non-compressible values indicated by code 253.  After
     that follows another 8-byte group of bytecodes, then those
     bytecodes' non-compressible values.  The pattern repeats to the end
     of the file or a code with value 252.

2: ZLIB compression
     The data record consists of the following, in order:

        * ZLIB data header, 24 bytes long.

        * One or more variable-length blocks of ZLIB compressed data.

        * ZLIB data trailer, with a 24-byte fixed header plus an
          additional 24 bytes for each preceding ZLIB compressed data
          block.

     The ZLIB data header has the following format:

          int64               zheader_ofs;
          int64               ztrailer_ofs;
          int64               ztrailer_len;

     'int64 zheader_ofs;'
          The offset, in bytes, of the beginning of this structure
          within the system file.

     'int64 ztrailer_ofs;'
          The offset, in bytes, of the first byte of the ZLIB data
          trailer.

     'int64 ztrailer_len;'
          The number of bytes in the ZLIB data trailer.  This and the
          previous field sum to the size of the system file in bytes.

     The data header is followed by '(ztrailer_ofs - 24) / 24' ZLIB
     compressed data blocks.  Each ZLIB compressed data block begins
     with a ZLIB header as specified in RFC 1950, e.g. hex bytes '78 01'
     (the only header yet observed in practice).  Each block
     decompresses to a fixed number of bytes (in practice only
     '0x3ff000'-byte blocks have been observed), except that the last
     block of data may be shorter.  The last ZLIB compressed data block
     gends just before offset 'ztrailer_ofs'.

     The result of ZLIB decompression is bytecode compressed data as
     described above for compression format 1.

     The ZLIB data trailer begins with the following 24-byte fixed
     header:

          int64               bias;
          int64               zero;
          int32               block_size;
          int32               n_blocks;

     'int64 int_bias;'
          The compression bias as a negative integer, e.g. if 'bias' in
          the file header record is 100.0, then 'int_bias' is -100 (this
          is the only value yet observed in practice).

     'int64 zero;'
          Always observed to be zero.

     'int32 block_size;'
          The number of bytes in each ZLIB compressed data block, except
          possibly the last, following decompression.  Only '0x3ff000'
          has been observed so far.

     'int32 n_blocks;'
          The number of ZLIB compressed data blocks, always exactly
          '(ztrailer_ofs - 24) / 24'.

     The fixed header is followed by 'n_blocks' 24-byte ZLIB data block
     descriptors, each of which describes the compressed data block
     corresponding to its offset.  Each block descriptor has the
     following format:

          int64               uncompressed_ofs;
          int64               compressed_ofs;
          int32               uncompressed_size;
          int32               compressed_size;

     'int64 uncompressed_ofs;'
          The offset, in bytes, that this block of data would have in a
          similar system file that uses compression format 1.  This is
          'zheader_ofs' in the first block descriptor, and in each
          succeeding block descriptor it is the sum of the previous
          desciptor's 'uncompressed_ofs' and 'uncompressed_size'.

     'int64 compressed_ofs;'
          The offset, in bytes, of the actual beginning of this
          compressed data block.  This is 'zheader_ofs + 24' in the
          first block descriptor, and in each succeeding block
          descriptor it is the sum of the previous descriptor's
          'compressed_ofs' and 'compressed_size'.  The final block
          descriptor's 'compressed_ofs' and 'compressed_size' sum to
          'ztrailer_ofs'.

     'int32 uncompressed_size;'
          The number of bytes in this data block, after decompression.
          This is 'block_size' in every data block except the last,
          which may be smaller.

     'int32 compressed_size;'
          The number of bytes in this data block, as stored compressed
          in this system file.

Appendix C SPSS/PC+ System File Format
**************************************

SPSS/PC+, first released in 1984, was a simplified version of SPSS for
IBM PC and compatible computers.  It used a data file format related to
the one described in the previous chapter, but simplified and
incompatible.  The SPSS/PC+ software became obsolete in the 1990s, so
files in this format are rarely encountered today.  Nevertheless, for
completeness, and because it is not very difficult, it seems worthwhile
to support at least reading these files.  This chapter documents this
format, based on examination of a corpus of about 60 files from a
variety of sources.

   System files use four data types: 8-bit characters, 16-bit unsigned
integers, 32-bit unsigned integers, and 64-bit floating points, called
here 'char', 'uint16', 'uint32', and 'flt64', respectively.  Data is not
necessarily aligned on a word or double-word boundary.

   SPSS/PC+ ran only on IBM PC and compatible computers.  Therefore,
values in these files are always in little-endian byte order.
Floating-point numbers are always in IEEE 754 format.

   SPSS/PC+ system files represent the system-missing value as
-1.66e308, or 'f5 1e 26 02 8a 8c ed ff' expressed as hexadecimal.  (This
is an unusual choice: it is close to, but not equal to, the largest
negative 64-bit IEEE 754, which is about -1.8e308.)

   Text in SPSS/PC+ system file is encoded in ASCII-based 8-bit MS DOS
codepages.  The corpus used for investigating the format were all
ASCII-only.

   An SPSS/PC+ system file begins with the following 256-byte directory:

     uint32              two;
     uint32              zero;
     struct {
         uint32          ofs;
         uint32          len;
     } records[15];
     char                filename[128];

'uint32 two;'
'uint32 zero;'
     Always set to 2 and 0, respectively.

     These fields could be used as a signature for the file format, but
     the 'product' field in record 0 seems more likely to be unique
     (*note Record 0 Main Header Record::).

'struct { ... } records[15];'
     Each of the elements in this array identifies a record in the
     system file.  The 'ofs' is a byte offset, from the beginning of the
     file, that identifies the start of the record.  'len' specifies the
     length of the record, in bytes.  Many records are optional or not
     used.  If a record is not present, 'ofs' and 'len' for that record
     are both are zero.

'char filename[128];'
     In most files in the corpus, this field is entirely filled with
     spaces.  In one file, it contains a file name, followed by a null
     bytes, followed by spaces to fill the remainder of the field.  The
     meaning is unknown.

   The following sections describe the contents of each record,
identified by the index into the 'records' array.

C.1 Record 0: Main Header Record
================================

All files in the corpus have this record at offset 0x100 with length
0xb0 (but readers should find this record, like the others, via the
'records' table in the directory).  Its format is:

     uint16              one0;
     char                product[62];
     flt64               sysmis;
     uint32              zero0;
     uint32              zero1;
     uint16              one1;
     uint16              compressed;
     uint16              nominal_case_size;
     uint16              n_cases0;
     uint16              weight_index;
     uint16              zero2;
     uint16              n_cases1;
     uint16              zero3;
     char                creation_date[8];
     char                creation_time[8];
     char                label[64];

'uint16 one0;'
'uint16 one1;'
     Always set to 1.

'uint32 zero0;'
'uint32 zero1;'
'uint16 zero2;'
'uint16 zero3;'
     Always set to 0.

     It seems likely that one of these variables is set to 1 if
     weighting is enabled, but none of the files in the corpus is
     weighted.

'char product[62];'
     Name of the program that created the file.  Only the following
     unique values have been observed, in each case padded on the right
     with spaces:

          DESPSS/PC+ System File Written by Data Entry II
          PCSPSS SYSTEM FILE.  IBM PC DOS, SPSS/PC+
          PCSPSS SYSTEM FILE.  IBM PC DOS, SPSS/PC+ V3.0
          PCSPSS SYSTEM FILE.  IBM PC DOS, SPSS for Windows

     Thus, it is reasonable to use the presence of the string 'SPSS' at
     offset 0x104 as a simple test for an SPSS/PC+ data file.

'flt64 sysmis;'
     The system-missing value, as described previously (*note SPSS/PC+
     System File Format::).

'uint16 compressed;'
     Set to 0 if the data in the file is not compressed, 1 if the data
     is compressed with simple bytecode compression.

'uint16 nominal_case_size;'
     Number of data elements per case.  This is the number of variables,
     except that long string variables add extra data elements (one for
     every 8 bytes after the first 8).  String variables in SPSS/PC+
     system files are limited to 255 bytes.

'uint16 n_cases0;'
'uint16 n_cases1;'
     The number of cases in the data record.  Both values are the same.
     Some files in the corpus contain data for the number of cases noted
     here, followed by garbage that somewhat resembles data.

'uint16 weight_index;'
     0, if the file is unweighted, otherwise a 1-based index into the
     data record of the weighting variable, e.g. 4 for the first
     variable after the 3 system-defined variables.

'char creation_date[8];'
     The date that the file was created, in 'mm/dd/yy' format.
     Single-digit days and months are not prefixed by zeros.  The string
     is padded with spaces on right or left or both, e.g.  '_2/4/93_',
     '10/5/87_', and '_1/11/88' (with '_' standing in for a space) are
     all actual examples from the corpus.

'char creation_time[8];'
     The time that the file was created, in 'HH:MM:SS' format.
     Single-digit hours are padded on a left with a space.  Minutes and
     seconds are always written as two digits.

'char file_label[64];'
     File label declared by the user, if any (*note (pspp)FILE LABEL::).
     Padded on the right with spaces.

C.2 Record 1: Variables Record
==============================

The variables record most commonly starts at offset 0x1b0, but it can be
placed elsewhere.  The record contains instances of the following
32-byte structure:

     uint32              value_label_start;
     uint32              value_label_end;
     uint32              var_label_ofs;
     uint32              format;
     char                name[8];
     union {
         flt64           f;
         char            s[8];
     } missing;

   The number of instances is the 'nominal_case_size' specified in the
main header record.  There is one instance for each numeric variable and
each string variable with width 8 bytes or less.  String variables wider
than 8 bytes have one instance for each 8 bytes, rounding up.  The first
instance for a long string specifies the variable's correct dictionary
information.  Subsequent instances for a long string are generally
filled with all-zero bytes, although the 'missing' field contains the
numeric system-missing value, and some writers also fill in
'var_label_ofs', 'format', and 'name', sometimes filling the latter with
the numeric system-missing value rather than a text string.  Regardless
of the values used, readers should ignore the contents of these
additional instances for long strings.

'uint32 value_label_start;'
'uint32 value_label_end;'
     For a variable with value labels, these specify offsets into the
     label record of the start and end of this variable's value labels,
     respectively.  *Note Record 2 Labels Record::, for more
     information.

     For a variable without any value labels, these are both zero.

     A long string variable may not have value labels.

'uint32 var_label_ofs;'
     For a variable with a variable label, this specifies an offset into
     the label record.  *Note Record 2 Labels Record::, for more
     information.

     For a variable without a variable label, this is zero.

'uint32 format;'
     The variable's output format, in the same format used in system
     files.  *Note System File Output Formats::, for details.  SPSS/PC+
     system files only use format types 5 (F, for numeric variables) and
     1 (A, for string variables).

'char name[8];'
     The variable's name, padded on the right with spaces.

'union { ... } missing;'
     A user-missing value.  For numeric variables, 'missing.f' is the
     variable's user-missing value.  For string variables, 'missing.s'
     is a string missing value.  A variable without a user-missing value
     is indicated with 'missing.f' set to the system-missing value, even
     for string variables (!).  A Long string variable may not have a
     missing value.

   In addition to the user-defined variables, every SPSS/PC+ system file
contains, as its first three variables, the following system-defined
variables, in the following order.  The system-defined variables have no
variable label, value labels, or missing values.

'$CASENUM'
     A numeric variable with format F8.0.  Most of the time this is a
     sequence number, starting with 1 for the first case and counting up
     for each subsequent case.  Some files skip over values, which
     probably reflects cases that were deleted.

'$DATE'
     A string variable with format A8.  Same format (including varying
     padding) as the 'creation_date' field in the main header record
     (*note Record 0 Main Header Record::).  The actual date can differ
     from 'creation_date' and from record to record.  This may reflect
     when individual cases were added or updated.

'$WEIGHT'
     A numeric variable with format F8.2.  This represents the case's
     weight; SPSS/PC+ files do not have a user-defined weighting
     variable.  If weighting has not been enabled, every case has value
     1.0.

C.3 Record 2: Labels Record
===========================

The labels record holds value labels and variable labels.  Unlike the
other records, it is not meant to be read directly and sequentially.
Instead, this record must be interpreted one piece at a time, by
following pointers from the variables record.

   The 'value_label_start', 'value_label_end', and 'var_label_ofs'
fields in a variable record are all offsets relative to the beginning of
the labels record, with an additional 7-byte offset.  That is, if the
labels record starts at byte offset 'labels_ofs' and a variable has a
given 'var_label_ofs', then the variable label begins at byte offset
'labels_ofs' + 'var_label_ofs' + 7 in the file.

   A variable label, starting at the offset indicated by
'var_label_ofs', consists of a one-byte length followed by the specified
number of bytes of the variable label string, like this:

     uint8               length;
     char                s[length];

   A set of value labels, extending from 'value_label_start' to
'value_label_end' (exclusive), consists of a numeric or string value
followed by a string in the format just described.  String values are
padded on the right with spaces to fill the 8-byte field, like this:

     union {
         flt64           f;
         char            s[8];
     } value;
     uint8               length;
     char                s[length];

   The labels record begins with a pair of uint32 values.  The first of
these is always 3.  The second is between 8 and 16 less than the number
of bytes in the record.  Neither value is important for interpreting the
file.


File: pspp-dev.info,  Node: Record 3 Data Record,  Next: Records 4 and 5 Data Entry,  Prev: Record 2 Labels Record,  Up: SPSS/PC+ System File Format

C.4 Record 3: Data Record
=========================

The format of the data record varies depending on the value of
'compressed' in the file header record:

0: no compression
     Data is arranged as a series of 8-byte elements, one per variable
     instance variable in the variable record (*note Record 1 Variables
     Record::).  Numeric values are given in 'flt64' format; string
     values are literal characters string, padded on the right with
     spaces when necessary to fill out 8-byte units.

1: bytecode compression
     The first 8 bytes of the data record is divided into a series of
     1-byte command codes.  These codes have meanings as described
     below:

     0
          The system-missing value.

     1
          A numeric or string value that is not compressible.  The value
          is stored in the 8 bytes following the current block of
          command bytes.  If this value appears twice in a block of
          command bytes, then it indicates the second group of 8 bytes
          following the command bytes, and so on.

     2 through 255
          A number with value CODE - 100, where CODE is the value of the
          compression code.  For example, code 105 indicates a numeric
          variable of value 5.

     The end of the 8-byte group of bytecodes is followed by any 8-byte
     blocks of non-compressible values indicated by code 1.  After that
     follows another 8-byte group of bytecodes, then those bytecodes'
     non-compressible values.  The pattern repeats up to the number of
     cases specified by the main header record have been seen.

     The corpus does not contain any files with command codes 2 through
     95, so it is possible that some of these codes are used for special
     purposes.

   Cases of data often, but not always, fill the entire data record.
Readers should stop reading after the number of cases specified in the
main header record.  Otherwise, readers may try to interpret garbage
following the data as additional cases.

D SPSS Viewer File Format
*************************

SPSS Viewer or '.spv' files, here called SPV files, are written by SPSS
16 and later to represent the contents of its output editor.  This
chapter documents the format, based on examination of a corpus of about
500 files from a variety of sources.  This description is detailed
enough to read SPV files, but probably not enough to write them.

   SPSS 15 and earlier versions use a completely different output format
based on the Microsoft Compound Document Format.  This format is not
documented here.

   An SPV file is a Zip archive that can be read with 'zipinfo' and
'unzip' and similar programs.  The final member in the Zip archive is a
file named 'META-INF/MANIFEST.MF'.  This structure makes SPV files
resemble Java "JAR" files (and ODF files), but whereas a JAR manifest
contains a sequence of colon-delimited key/value pairs, an SPV manifest
contains the string 'allowPivoting=true', without a new-line.  (This
string may be the best way to identify an SPV file; it is invariant
across the corpus.)

   The rest of the members in an SPV file's Zip archive fall into two
categories: "structure" and "detail" members.  Structure member names
begin with 'outputViewerNNNNNNNNNN', where each N is a decimal digit,
and end with '.xml', and often include the string '_heading' in between.
Each of these members represents some kind of output item (a table, a
heading, a block of text, etc.)  or a group of them.  The member whose
output goes at the beginning of the document is numbered 0, the next
member in the output is numbered 1, and so on.

   Structure members contain XML. This XML is sometimes self-contained,
but it often references detail members in the Zip archive, which are
named as follows:

'PREFIX_table.xml' and 'PREFIX_tableData.bin'
'PREFIX_lightTableData.bin'
     The structure of a table plus its data.  Older SPV files pair a
     'PREFIX_table.xml' file that describes the table's structure with a
     binary 'PREFIX_tableData.bin' file that gives its data.  Newer SPV
     files (the majority of those in the corpus) instead include a
     single 'PREFIX_lightTableData.bin' file that incorporates both into
     a single binary format.

'PREFIX_warning.xml' and 'PREFIX_warningData.bin'
'PREFIX_lightWarningData.bin'
     Same format used for tables, with a different name.

'PREFIX_notes.xml' and 'PREFIX_notesData.bin'
'PREFIX_lightNotesData.bin'
     Same format used for tables, with a different name.

'PREFIX_chartData.bin' and 'PREFIX_chart.xml'
     The structure of a chart plus its data.  Charts do not have a
     "light" format.

'PREFIX_pmml.scf'
'PREFIX_stats.scf'
'PREFIX_model.xml'
     Not yet investigated.  The corpus contains few examples.

   The 'PREFIX' in the names of the detail members is typically an
11-digit decimal number that increases for each item, tending to skip
values.  Older SPV files use different naming conventions.  Structure
member refer to detail members by name, and so their exact names do not
matter to readers as long as they are unique.

D.1 Structure Member Format
===========================

Structure members' XML files claim conformance with a collection of XML
Schemas.  These schemas are distributed, under a nonfree license, with
SPSS binaries.  Fortunately, the schemas are not necessary to understand
the structure members.  To a degree, the schemas can even be deceptive
because they document elements and attributes that are not in the corpus
and do not document elements and attributes that are commonly found
there.

   Structure members use a different XML namespace for each schema, but
these namespaces are not entirely consistent.  In some SPV files, for
example, the 'viewer-tree' schema is associated with namespace
'http://xml.spss.com/spss/viewer-tree' and in others with
'http://xml.spss.com/spss/viewer/viewer-tree' (note the additional
'viewer/').  Under either name, the schema URIs are not resolvable to
obtain the schemas themselves.

   One may ignore all of the above in interpreting a structure member.
The actual XML has a simple and straightforward form that does not
require a reader to take schemas or namespaces into account.

   The elements found in structure members are documented below.  For
each element, we note the possible parent elements and the element's
contents.  The contents are specified as pseudo-regular expressions with
the following conventions:

text
     XML text content.

CDATA
     XML CDATA content.

'element'
     The named element.

(...)
     Grouping multiple elements.

[X]
     An optional X.

A | B
     A choice between A and B.

X*
     Zero or more X.

structure member, please refer to a PDF version of the manual.

D.1.1 The 'heading' Element
---------------------------

Parent: Document root or 'heading'
Contents: ['pageSetup'] 'label' ('container' | 'heading')*

   The root of a structure member is a 'heading', which represents a
section of output beginning with a title (the 'label') and ordinarily
followed by content containers or further nested (sub)-sections of
output.

   The document root heading, only, may also contain a 'pageSetup'
element.

   The following attributes have been observed on both document root and
nested 'heading' elements.

 -- Optional: creator-version
     The version of the software that created this SPV file.  A string
     of the form 'xxyyzzww' represents software version xx.yy.zz.ww,
     e.g. '21000001' is version 21.0.0.1.  Trailing pairs of zeros are
     sometimes omitted, so that '21', '210000', and '21000000' are all
     version 21.0.0.0 (and the corpus contains all three of those
     forms).

The following attributes have been observed on document root 'heading'
elements only:

 -- Optional: 'creator'
     The directory in the file system of the software that created this
     SPV file.

 -- Optional: 'creation-date-time'
     The date and time at which the SPV file was written, in a
     locale-specific format, e.g.  'Friday, May 16, 2014 6:47:37 PM PDT'
     or 'lunedì 17 marzo 2014 3.15.48 CET' or even 'Friday, December 5,
     2014 5:00:19 o'clock PM EST'.

 -- Optional: 'lockReader'
     Whether a reader should be allowed to edit the output.  The
     possible values are 'true' and 'false', but the corpus only
     contains 'false'.

 -- Optional: 'schemaLocation'
     This is actually an XML Namespace attribute.  A reader may ignore
     it.

The following attributes have been observed only on nested 'heading'
elements:

 -- Required: 'commandName'
     The locale-invariant name of the command that produced the output,
     e.g. 'Frequencies', 'T-Test', 'Non Par Corr'.

 -- Optional: 'visibility'
     To what degree the output represented by the element is visible.
     The only observed value is 'collapsed'.

 -- Optional: 'locale'
     The locale used for output, in Windows format, which is similar to
     the format used in Unix with the underscore replaced by a hyphen,
     e.g. 'en-US', 'en-GB', 'el-GR', 'sr-Cryl-RS'.

 -- Optional: 'olang'
     The output language, e.g. 'en', 'it', 'es', 'de', 'pt-BR'.

D.1.2 The 'label' Element
-------------------------

Parent: 'heading' or 'container'
Contents: text

   Every 'heading' and 'container' holds a 'label' as its first child.
The root 'heading' in a structure member always contains the string
"Output".  Otherwise, the text in 'label' describes what it labels,
often by naming the statistical procedure that was executed, e.g.
"Frequencies" or "T-Test".  Labels are often very generic, especially
within a 'container', e.g. "Title" or "Warnings" or "Notes".  Label text
is localized according to the output language, e.g. in Italian a
frequency table procedure is labeled "Frequenze".

   The corpus contains one example of an empty label, one that contains
no text.

   This element has no attributes.

D.1.3 The 'container' Element
-----------------------------

Parent: 'heading'
Contents: 'label' ['table' | 'text']

   A 'container' serves to label a 'table' or a 'text' item.

   This element has the following attributes.

 -- Required: 'visibility'
     Either 'visible' or 'hidden', this indicates whether the
     container's content is displayed.

 -- Optional: 'text-align'
     Presumably indicates the alignment of text within the container.
     The only observed value is 'left'.  Observed with nested 'table'
     and 'text' elements.

 -- Optional: 'width'
     The width of the container in the form 'Npx', e.g. '1097px'.

D.1.4 The 'text' Element (Inside 'container')
---------------------------------------------

Parent: 'container'
Contents: 'html'

   This 'text' element is nested inside a 'container'.  There is a
different 'text' element that is nested inside a 'pageParagraph'.

   This element has the following attributes.

 -- Required: 'type'
     One of 'title', 'log', or 'text'.

 -- Optional: 'commandName'
     As on the 'heading' element.  For output not specific to a command,
     this is simply 'log'.  The corpus contains one example of where
     'commandName' is present but set to the empty string.

 -- Optional: 'creator-version'
     As on the 'heading' element.

D.1.5 The 'html' Element
------------------------

Parent: 'text'
Contents: CDATA

   The CDATA contains an HTML document.  In some cases, the document
starts with '<html>' and ends with '</html'; in others the 'html'
element is implied.  Generally the HTML includes a 'head' element with a
CSS stylesheet.  The HTML body often begins with '<BR>'.  The actual
content ranges from trivial to simple: just discarding the CSS and tags
yields readable results.

   This element has the following attributes.

 -- Required: 'lang'
     This always contains 'en' in the corpus.

-------------------------

Parent: 'container'
Contents: 'tableStructure'

   This element has the following attributes.

 -- Required: 'commandName'
     As on the 'heading' element.

 -- Required: 'type'
     One of 'table', 'note', or 'warning'.

 -- Required: 'subType'
     The locale-invariant name for the particular kind of output that
     this table represents in the procedure.  This can be the same as
     'commandName' e.g. 'Frequencies', or different, e.g. 'Case
     Processing Summary'.  Generic subtypes 'Notes' and 'Warnings' are
     often used.

 -- Required: 'tableId'
     A number that uniquely identifies the table within the SPV file,
     typically a large negative number such as '-4147135649387905023'.

 -- Optional: 'creator-version'
     As on the 'heading' element.  In the corpus, this is only present
     for version 21 and up and always includes all 8 digits.

Parent: 'pageParagraph'
Contents: [CDATA]

   This 'text' element is nested inside a 'pageParagraph'.  There is a
different 'text' element that is nested inside a 'container'.

   The element is either empty, or contains CDATA that holds
almost-XHTML text: in the corpus, either an 'html' or 'p' element.  It
is _almost_-XHTML because the 'html' element designates the default
namespace as 'http://xml.spss.com/spss/viewer/viewer-tree' instead of an
XHTML namespace, and because the CDATA can contain substitution
variables: '&[Page]' for the page number and '&[PageTitle]' for the page
title.

   Typical contents (indented for clarity):

     <html xmlns="http://xml.spss.com/spss/viewer/viewer-tree">
         <head></head>
         <body>
             <p style="text-align:right; margin-top: 0">Page &[Page]</p>

D.2 Light Detail Member Format
==============================

This section describes the format of "light" detail '.bin' members.
These members have a binary format which we describe here in terms of a
context-free grammar using the following conventions:

NonTerminal => ...
     Nonterminals have CamelCaps names, and => indicates a production.
     The right-hand side of a production is often broken across multiple
     lines.  Break points are chosen for aesthetics only and have no
     semantic significance.

00, 01, ..., ff.
     Bytes with fixed values are written in hexadecimal:

i0, i1, ..., i9, i10, i11, ...
     32-bit integers with fixed values are written in decimal, prefixed
     by 'i'.

byte
     An arbitrary byte.

int
     An arbitrary 32-bit integer.

double
     An arbitrary 64-bit IEEE floating-point number.

string
     A 32-bit integer followed by the specified number of bytes of
     character data.  (The encoding is indicated by the Formats
     nonterminal.)

X?
     X is optional, e.g. 00?  is an optional zero byte.

X*N
     X is repeated N times, e.g.  byte*10 for ten arbitrary bytes.

X[NAME]
     Gives X the specified NAME.  Names are used in textual
     explanations.  They are also used, also bracketed, to indicate
     counts, e.g. int[n] byte*[n] for a 32-bit integer followed by the
     specified number of arbitrary bytes.

A | B
     Either A or B.

(X)
     Parentheses are used for grouping to make precedence clear,
     especially in the presence of |, e.g. in 00 (01 | 02 | 03) 00.

count(X)
     A 32-bit integer that indicates the number of bytes in X, followed
     by X itself.

v1(X)
     In a version 1 '.bin' member, X; in version 3, nothing.  (The
     '.bin' header indicates the version.)

v3(X)
     In a version 3 '.bin' member, X; in version 1, nothing.

   All integer and floating-point values in this format use
little-endian byte order.

   A "light" detail member '.bin' consists of a number of sections
concatenated together, terminated by a byte 01:

LightMember => Header Title Caption Footnotes Fonts Formats Dimensions Data 01

D.2.1 Header
------------

An SPV file begins with an 39-byte header:

Header =>
    01 00
    (i1 | i3)[version]
    01 (00 | 01) byte*21 00 00
    int[table-id] byte*4

   'version' is a version number that affects the interpretation of some
of the other data in the member.  We will refer to "version 1" and
"version 3" later on and use v1(...) and v3(...) for version-specific
formatting (as described previously).

   'table-id' is a binary version of the 'tableId' attribute in the
structure member that refers to the detail member.  For example, if
'tableId' is '-4154297861994971133', then 'table-id' would be
0xdca00003.

   The meaning of the other variable parts of the header is not known.

D.2.2 Title
-----------

Title =>
    Value[title1] 01?
    Value[c] 01? 31
    Value[title2] 01? 00? 58

   The Title, which follows the Header, specifies the pivot table's
title twice, as 'title1' and 'title2'.  In the corpus, they are always
the same.

   Whereas the Value in 'title1' and in 'title2' are appropriate for
presentation, and localized to the user's language, 'c' is in English,
sometimes less specific, and sometimes less well formatted.  For
example, for a frequency table, 'title1' and 'title2' name the variable
and 'c' is simply "Frequencies".

D.2.5 Fonts
-----------

Fonts => 00 Font*8
Font =>
    byte[index] 31 string[typeface] 00 00
    (10 | 20 | 40 | 50 | 70 | 80)[f1] 41
    (i0 | i1 | i2)[f2] 00
    (i0 | i2 | i64173)[f3]
    (i0 | i1 | i2 | i3)[f4]
    string[fgcolor] string[bgcolor] i0 i0 00
    v3(int[f5] int[f6] int[f7] int[f8]))

   Each Font represents the font style for a different element, in the
following order: title, caption, footnote, row labels, column labels,
corner labels, data, and layers.

   'index' is the 1-based index of the Font, i.e.  1 for the first Font,
through 8 for the final Font.

   'typeface' is the string name of the font.  In the corpus, this is
'SansSerif' in over 99% of instances and 'Times New Roman' in the rest.

   'fgcolor' and 'bgcolor' are the foreground color and background
color, respectively.  In the corpus, these are always '#000000' and
'#ffffff', respectively.

   The meaning of the remaining data is unknown.  It seems likely to
include font sizes, horizontal and vertical alignment, attributes such
as bold or italic, and margins.

   The table below lists the values observed in the corpus.  When a cell
contains a single value, then 99+% of the corpus contains that value.
When a cell contains a pair of values, then the first value is seen in
about two-thirds of the corpus and the second value in about the
remaining one-third.  In fonts that include multiple pairs, values are
correlated, that is, for font 3, f5 = 24, f6 = 24, f7 = 2 appears about
two-thirds of the time, as does the combination of f4 = 0, f6 = 10 for
font 7.

    int[n-ccs] string*[n-ccs]
    2e (00 | 01) (i2000000 i0)?

   In every example in the corpus, 'n1' is 240.  The meaning of the
bytes that follow it is unknown.

   In every example in the corpus, 'n2' is 18 and the bytes that follow
it are '00 00 00 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 02 00 00 00 00'.  The
meaning of these bytes is unknown.

   In every example in the corpus for version 1, 'n3' is 16 and the
bytes that follow it are '00 00 00 01 00 00 00 01 00 00 00 00 01 01 01
01'.  In version 3, observed 'n3' varies from 117 to 150, and its bytes
include a 1-byte count at offset 0x34.  When the count is nonzero, a
text string of that length at offset 0x35 is the name of a "TableLook",
e.g.  "Default" or "Academic".

   Observed values of 'n4' vary from 0 to 17.  Out of 7,060 examples in
the corpus, it is nonzero only 36 times.

   'encoding' is a character encoding, usually a Windows code page such
as 'en_US.windows-1252' or 'it_IT.windows-1252'.  The rest of the
character strings in the member use this encoding.  The encoding string
is itself encoded in US-ASCII.

   'decimal' is the decimal point character.  The observed values are
'.' and ','.

   'grouping' is the grouping character.  Usually, it is ',' if
'decimal' is '.', and vice versa.  Other observed values are '''
(apostrophe), ' ' (space), and zero (presumably indicating that digits
should not be grouped).

   'n-ccs' is observed as either 0 or 5.  When it is 5, the following
strings are CCA through CCE format strings.  *Note (pspp)Custom Currency
Formats::.  Most commonly these are all '-,,,' but other strings occur.

D.2.7 Dimensions
----------------

A pivot table presents multidimensional data.  A Dimension identifies
the categories associated with each dimension.

Dimensions => int[n-dims] Dimension*[n-dims]
Dimension => Value[name] DimUnknown int[n-categories] Category*[n-categories]
DimUnknown =>
    byte[d1]
    (00 | 01 | 02)[d2]
    (i0 | i2)[d3]
    (00 | 01)[d4]
    (00 | 01)[d5]
    01
    int[d6]

   'name' is the name of the dimension, e.g.  'Variables', 'Statistics',
or a variable name.

   'd1' is usually 0 but many other values have been observed.

   'd3' is 2 over 99% of the time.

   'd5' is 0 over 99% of the time.

   'd6' is either -1 or the 0-based index of the dimension, e.g. 0 for
the first dimension, 1 for the second, and so on.  The latter is the
case 98% of the time in the corpus.


File: pspp-dev.info,  Node: SPV Light Member Categories,  Next: SPV Light Member Data,  Prev: SPV Light Member Dimensions,  Up: SPV Light Detail Member Format

D.2.8 Categories
----------------

Categories are arranged in a tree.  Only the leaf nodes in the tree are
really categories; the others just serve as grouping constructs.

Category => Value[name] (Leaf | Group)
Leaf => 00 00 00 i2 int[index] i0
Group =>
    (00 | 01)[merge] 00 01 (i0 | i2)[data]
    i-1 int[n-subcategories] Category*[n-subcategories]

   'name' is the name of the category (or group).

   A Leaf represents a leaf category.  The Leaf's 'index' is a
nonnegative integer less than 'n-categories' in the Dimension in which
the Category is nested (directly or indirectly).

   A Group represents a Group of nested categories.  Usually a Group
contains at least one Category, so that 'n-subcategories' is positive,
but a few Groups with 'n-subcategories' 0 has been observed.

   If a Group's 'merge' is 00, the most common value, then the group is
really a distinct group that should be represented as such in the visual
representation and user interface.  If 'merge' is 01, the categories in
this group should be shown and treated as if they were direct children
of the group's containing group (or if it has no parent group, then
direct children of the dimension), and this group's name is irrelevant
and should not be displayed.  (Merged groups can be nested!)

   A Group's 'data' appears to be i2 when all of the categories within a
group are leaf categories that directly represent data values for a
variable (e.g.  in a frequency table or crosstabulation, a group of
values in a variable being tabulated) and i0 otherwise.

D.2.9 Data
----------

The final part of an SPV light member contains the actual data.

Data =>
    int[layers] int[rows] int[columns] int*[n-dimensions]
    int[n-data] Datum*[n-data]
Datum => int64[index] v3(00?) Value

   The values of 'layers', 'rows', and 'columns' each specifies the
number of dimensions displayed in layers, rows, and columns,
respectively.  Any of them may be zero.  Their values sum to
'n-dimensions' from Dimensions (*note SPV Light Member Dimensions::).

   The 'n-dimensions' integers are a permutation of the 0-based
dimension numbers.  The first 'layers' integers specify each of the
dimensions represented by layers, the next 'rows' integers specify the
dimensions represented by rows, and the final 'columns' integers specify
the dimensions represented by columns.  When there is more than one
dimension of a given kind, the inner dimensions are given first.

   The format of a Datum varies slightly from version 1 to version 3: in
version 1 it allows for an extra optional 00 byte.

   A Datum consists of an 'index' and a Value.  Suppose there are d
dimensions and dimension i, 0 \le i < d, has n_i categories.  Consider
the datum at coordinates x_i, 0 \le i < d, and note that 0 \le x_i <
n_i.  Then the index is calculated by the following algorithm:

     let index = 0
     for each i from 0 to d - 1:
         index = (n_i \times index) + x_i

   For example, suppose there are 3 dimensions with 3, 4, and 5
categories, respectively.  The datum at coordinates (1, 2, 3) has index
5 \times (4 \times (3 \times 0 + 1) + 2) + 3 = 33.

D.2.10 Value
------------

Value is used throughout the SPV light member format.  It boils down to
a number or a string.

Value => 00? 00? 00? 00? RawValue
RawValue =>
    01 ValueMod int[format] double[x]
  | 02 ValueMod int[format] double[x]
    string[varname] string[vallab] (01 | 02 | 03)
  | 03 string[local] ValueMod string[id] string[c] (00 | 01)[type]
  | 04 ValueMod int[format] string[vallab] string[varname]
    (01 | 02 | 03) string[s]
  | 05 ValueMod string[varname] string[varlabel] (01 | 02 | 03)
  | ValueMod string[format] int[n-args] Argument*[n-args]
Argument =>
    i0 Value
  | int[x] i0 Value*[x+1]      /* x > 0 */

   There are several possible encodings, which one can distinguish by
the first nonzero byte in the encoding.

01
     The numeric value 'x', intended to be presented to the user
     formatted according to 'format', which is in the format described
     for system files.  *Note System File Output Formats::, for details.
     Most commonly, 'format' has width 40 (the maximum).

     An 'x' with the maximum negative double value '-DBL_MAX' represents
     the system-missing value SYSMIS. (HIGHEST and LOWEST have not been
     observed.)  *Note System File Format::, for more about these
     special values.

02
     Similar to '01', with the additional information that 'x' is a
     value of variable 'varname' and has value label 'vallab'.  Both
     'varname' and 'vallab' can be the empty string, the latter very
     commonly.

     The meaning of the final byte is unknown.  Possibly it is connected
     to whether the value or the label should be displayed.

03
     A text string, in two forms: 'c' is in English, and sometimes
     abbreviated or obscure, and 'local' is localized to the user's
     locale.  In an English-language locale, the two strings are often
     the same, and in the cases where they differ, 'local' is more
     appropriate for a user interface, e.g. 'c' of "Not a PxP table for
     MCN..." versus 'local' of "Computed only for a PxP table, where P
     must be greater than 1."

     'c' and 'local' are always either both empty or both nonempty.

     'id' is a brief identifying string whose form seems to resemble a
     programming language identifier, e.g. 'cumulative_percent' or
     'factor_14'.  It is not unique.

     'type' is 00 for text taken from user input, such as syntax
     fragment, expressions, file names, data set names, and 01 for fixed
     text strings such as names of procedures or statistics.  In the
     former case, 'id' is always the empty string; in the latter case,
     'id' is still sometimes empty.

04
     The string value 's', intended to be presented to the user
     formatted according to 'format'.  The format for a string is not
     too interesting, and the corpus contains many clearly invalid
     formats like A16.39 or A255.127 or A134.1, so readers should
     probably ignore the format entirely.

     's' is a value of variable 'varname' and has value label 'vallab'.
     'varname' is never empty but 'vallab' is commonly empty.

     The meaning of the final byte is unknown.

05
     Variable 'varname', which is rarely observed as empty in the
     corpus, with variable label 'varlabel', which is often empty.

     The meaning of the final byte is unknown.

31 or 58
     (These bytes begin a ValueMod.)  A format string, analogous to
     'printf', followed by one or more Arguments, each of which has one
     or more values.  The format string uses the following syntax:

     '\%'
     '\:'
     '\['
     '\]'
          Each of these expands to the character following '\\', to
          escape characters that have special meaning in format strings.
          These are effective inside and outside the '[...]' syntax
          forms described below.

     '\n'
          Expands to a new-line, inside or outside the '[...]' forms
          described below.

     '^I'
          Expands to a formatted version of argument I, which must have
          only a single value.  For example, '^1' expands to the first
          argument's 'value'.

     '[:A:]I'
          Expands A for each of the values in I.  A should contain one
          or more '^J' conversions, which are drawn from the values for
          argument I in order.  Some examples from the corpus:

          '[:^1:]1'
               All of the values for the first argument, concatenated.

          '[:^1\n:]1'
               Expands to the values for the first argument, each
               followed by a new-line.

          '[:^1 = ^2:]2'
               Expands to 'X = Y' where X is the second argument's first
               value and Y is its second value.  (This would be used
               only if the argument has two values.  If there were more
               values, the second and third values would be directly
               concatenated, which would look funny.)

     '[A:B:]I'
          This extends the previous form so that the first values are
          expanded using A and later values are expanded using B.  For
          an unknown reason, within A the '^J' conversions are instead
          written as '%J'.  Some examples from the corpus:

          '[%1:*^1:]1'
               Expands to all of the values for the first argument,
               separated by '*'.

          '[%1 = %2:, ^1 = ^2:]1'
               Given appropriate values for the first argument, expands
               to 'X = 1, Y = 2, Z = 3'.

          '[%1:, ^1:]1'
               Given appropriate values, expands to '1, 2, 3'.

     The format string is localized to the user's locale.

ValueModUnknown => 58 | 31 i0 i0 i0 i0 01 00 (01 | 02 | 08) 00 08 00 0a 00)

   The 'footnote-number', if present, specifies a footnote that the
Value references.  The footnote's marker is shown appended to the main
text of the Value, as a superscript.

   The 'subscript', if present, specifies a string to append to the main
text of the Value, as a subscript.  The subscript text is a brief
indicator, e.g. 'a' or 'a,b', with its meaning indicated by the table
caption.  In this usage, subscripts are similar to footnotes; one
apparent difference is that a Value can only reference one footnote but
a subscript can list more than one letter.

   The Format, if present, is a format string for substitutions using
the syntax explained previously.  It appears to be an English-language
version of the localized format string in the Value in which the Format
is nested.

   The Style, if present, changes the style for this individual Value.

D.3 Legacy Detail Member Binary Format
======================================

Whereas the light binary format represents everything about a given
pivot table, the legacy binary format conceptually consists of a number
of named sources, each of which consists of a number of named series,
each of which is a 1-dimensional array of numbers or strings or a mix.
Thus, the legacy binary member format is quite simple.

   This section uses the same context-free grammar notation as in the
previous section, with the following additions:

vAF(X)
     In a version 0xaf legacy member, X; in other versions, nothing.
     (The legacy member header indicates the version; see below.)

vB0(X)
     In a version 0xb0 legacy member, X; in other versions, nothing.

   A legacy detail member '.bin' has the following overall format:

LegacyBinary =>
    00 byte[version] int16[n-sources] int[member-size]
    Metadata*[n-sources] Data*[n-sources]

   'version' is a version number that affects the interpretation of some
of the other data in the member.  Versions 0xaf and 0xb0 are known.  We
will refer to "version 0xaf" and "version 0xb0" members later on.

   A legacy member consists of 'n-sources' data sources, each of which
has Metadata and Data.

   'member-size' is the size of the legacy binary member, in bytes.

   The following sections go into more detail.

File: pspp-dev.info,  Node: SPV Legacy Member Metadata,  Next: SPV Legacy Member Data,  Up: SPV Legacy Detail Member Binary Format

D.3.1 Metadata
--------------

Metadata =>
    int[per-series] int[n-series] int[offset]
    vAF(byte*32[source-name])
    vB0(byte*64[source-name] int[x])

   A data source consists of 'n-series' series of data, with
'per-series' data values per series.

   'source-name' is a 32- or 64-byte string padded on the right with
zero bytes.  The names that appear in the corpus are very generic,
usually 'tableData' or 'source0'.

   A given Metadata's 'offset' is the offset, in bytes, from the
beginning of the member to the start of the corresponding Data.  This
allows programs to skip to the beginning of the data for a particular
source; it is also important to determine whether a source includes any
string data (*note SPV Legacy Member Data::).

   The meaning of 'x' in version 0xb0 is unknown.


File: pspp-dev.info,  Node: SPV Legacy Member Data,  Prev: SPV Legacy Member Metadata,  Up: SPV Legacy Detail Member Binary Format

D.3.2 Data
----------

Data => NumericData StringData?
NumericData => NumericSeries*[n-series]
NumericSeries => byte*288[series-name] double*[per-series]

   Data follow the Metadata in the legacy binary format, with sources in
the same order.  Each NumericSeries begins with a 'series-name' that
generally indicates its role in the pivot table, e.g. "cell",
"cellFormat", "dimension0categories", "dimension0group0", followed by
the numeric data, one double per element in the series.  A double with
the maximum negative double '-DBL_MAX' represents the system-missing
value SYSMIS.

StringData => i1 string[source-name] Pairs Labels

Pairs => int[n-string-series] PairSeries*[n-string-series]
PairSeries => string[pair-series-name] int[n-pairs] Pair*[n-pairs]
Pair => int[i] int[j]

Labels => int[n-labels] Label*[n-labels]
Label => int[frequency] int[s]

   A source may include a mix of numeric and string data values.  When a
source includes any string data, the data values that are strings are
set to SYSMIS in the NumericSeries, and StringData follows the
NumericData.  A source that contains no string data omits the
StringData.  To reliably determine whether a source includes StringData,
the reader should check whether the offset following the NumericData is
the offset of the next series, as indicated by its Metadata (or the end
of the member, in the case of the last source).

   StringData repeats the name of the source (from Metadata).

   The string data overlays the numeric data.  'n-string-series' is the
number of series within the source that include string data.  More
precisely, it is the 1-based index of the last series in the source that
includes any string data; thus, it would be 4 if there are 5 series and
only the fourth one includes string data.

   Each PairSeries consists a sequence of 0 or more Pair nonterminals,
each of which maps from a 0-based index within series 'i' to a 0-based
label index 'j', e.g. pair 'i' = 2, 'j' = 3, means that the third data
value (with value SYSMIS) is to be replaced by the string of the fourth
Label.

   The labels themselves follow the pairs.  The valuable part of each
label is the string 's'.  Each label also includes a 'frequency' that
reports the number of pairs that reference it (although this is not
useful).

E Encrypted File Wrappers
*************************

SPSS 21 and later can package multiple kinds of files inside an
encrypted wrapper.  The wrapper has a common format, regardless of the
kind of the file that it contains.

     Warning: The SPSS encryption wrapper is poorly designed.  It is
     much cheaper and faster to decrypt a file encrypted this way than
     if a well designed alternative were used.  If you must use this
     format, use a 10-byte randomly generated password.

* Menu:

* Common Wrapper Format::
* Password Encoding::


File: pspp-dev.info,  Node: Common Wrapper Format,  Next: Password Encoding,  Up: Encrypted File Wrappers

E.1 Common Wrapper Format
=========================

This section describes the general format of an SPSS encrypted file
wrapper.  The following sections describe the details for each kind of
encapsulated file.

   An encrypted file wrapper begins with the following 36-byte header,
where xxx identifies the type of file encapsulated, as described in the
following sections:

     0000  1c 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  45 4e 43 52 59 50 54 45  |........ENCRYPTE|
     0010  44 xx xx xx 15 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  |Dxxx............|
     0020  00 00 00 00                                       |....|

   Following the fixed header is essentially the regular contents of the
encapsulated file in its usual format, with each 16-byte block encrypted
with AES-256 in ECB mode.  Each type of encapsulated file is processed
in a slightly different way before encryption, as described in the
following sections.  The AES-256 key is derived from a password in the
following way:

  1. Start from the literal password typed by the user.  Truncate it to
     at most 10 bytes, then append as many null bytes as necessary until
     there are exactly 32 bytes.  Call this PASSWORD.

  2. Let CONSTANT be the following 73-byte constant:

          0000  00 00 00 01 35 27 13 cc  53 a7 78 89 87 53 22 11
          0010  d6 5b 31 58 dc fe 2e 7e  94 da 2f 00 cc 15 71 80
          0020  0a 6c 63 53 00 38 c3 38  ac 22 f3 63 62 0e ce 85
          0030  3f b8 07 4c 4e 2b 77 c7  21 f5 1a 80 1d 67 fb e1
          0040  e1 83 07 d8 0d 00 00 01  00

  3. Compute CMAC-AES-256(PASSWORD, CONSTANT).  Call the 16-byte result
     CMAC.

  4. The 32-byte AES-256 key is CMAC || CMAC, that is, CMAC repeated
     twice.

Example
-------

Consider the password 'pspp'.  PASSWORD is:

     0000  70 73 70 70 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  |pspp............|
     0010  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  |................|

CMAC is:

     0000  3e da 09 8e 66 04 d4 fd  f9 63 0c 2c a8 6f b0 45

The AES-256 key is:

     0000  3e da 09 8e 66 04 d4 fd  f9 63 0c 2c a8 6f b0 45
     0010  3e da 09 8e 66 04 d4 fd  f9 63 0c 2c a8 6f b0 45

E.1.1 Encrypted System Files
----------------------------

An encrypted system file uses 'SAV' as the identifier in its header.

   Before encryption, a system file is appended with as many null bytes
as needed (possibly zero) to make it a multiple of 16 bytes in length,
so that it fits exactly in a series of AES blocks.  (This implies that
encrypted system files must always be compressed, because otherwise a
system file with only a single variable might appear to have an extra
case.)


File: pspp-dev.info,  Node: Encrypted Syntax Files,  Prev: Encrypted System Files,  Up: Common Wrapper Format

E.1.2 Encrypted Syntax Files
----------------------------

An encrypted syntax file uses 'SPS' as the identifier in its header.

   Before encryption, a syntax file is prefixed with a line at the
beginning of the form '* Encoding: ENCODING.', where ENCODING is the
encoding used for the rest of the file, e.g.  'windows-1252'.  The
syntax file is then appended with as many bytes with value 04 as needed
(possibly zero) to make it a multiple of 16 bytes in length.

E.2 Password Encoding
=====================

SPSS also supports what it calls "encrypted passwords."  These are not
encrypted.  They are encoded with a simple, fixed scheme.  An encoded
password is always a multiple of 2 characters long, and never longer
than 20 characters.  The characters in an encoded password are always in
the graphic ASCII range 33 through 126.  Each successive pair of
characters in the password encodes a single byte in the plaintext
password.

   Use the following algorithm to decode a pair of characters:

  1. Let A be the ASCII code of the first character, and B be the ASCII
     code of the second character.

  2. Let AH be the most significant 4 bits of A.  Find the line in the
     table below that has AH on the left side.  The right side of the
     line is a set of possible values for the most significant 4 bits of
     the decoded byte.

          2  => 2367
          3  => 0145
          47 => 89cd
          56 => abef

  3. Let BH be the most significant 4 bits of B.  Find the line in the
     second table below that has BH on the left side.  The right side of
     the line is a set of possible values for the most significant 4
     bits of the decoded byte.  Together with the results of the
     previous step, only a single possibility is left.

          2  => 139b
          3  => 028a
          47 => 46ce
          56 => 57df

  4. Let AL be the least significant 4 bits of A.  Find the line in the
     table below that has AL on the left side.  The right side of the
     line is a set of possible values for the least significant 4 bits
     of the decoded byte.

          03cf => 0145
          12de => 2367
          478b => 89cd
          569a => abef

  5. Let BL be the least significant 4 bits of B.  Find the line in the
     table below that has BL on the left side.  The right side of the
     line is a set of possible values for the least significant 4 bits
     of the decoded byte.  Together with the results of the previous
     step, only a single possibility is left.

          03cf => 028a
          12de => 139b
          478b => 46ce
          569a => 57df

Example
-------

Consider the encoded character pair '-|'.  A is 0x2d and B is 0x7c, so
AH is 2, BH is 7, AL is 0xd, and BL is 0xc.  AH means that the most
significant four bits of the decoded character is 2, 3, 6, or 7, and BH
means that they are 4, 6, 0xc, or 0xe.  The single possibility in common
is 6, so the most significant four bits are 6.  Similarly, AL means that
the least significant four bits are 2, 3, 6, or 7, and BL means they are
0, 2, 8, or 0xa, so the least significant four bits are 2.  The decoded
character is therefore 0x62, the letter 'b'.

     q2c INPUT.Q OUTPUT.C

command-line arguments, which are the input file name and output file
name, respectively.  'q2c' does not accept any command-line options.


File: pspp-dev.info,  Node: q2c Input Structure,  Next: Grammar Rules,  Prev: Invoking q2c,  Up: q2c Input Format

F.2 'q2c' Input Structure
=========================

'q2c' input files are divided into two sections: the grammar rules and
the supporting code.  The "grammar rules", which make up the first part
of the input, are used to define the syntax of the statistical procedure
to be parsed.  The "supporting code", following the grammar rules, are
copied largely unchanged to the output file, except for certain escapes.

   The most important lines in the grammar rules are used for defining
procedure syntax.  These lines can be prefixed with a dollar sign ('$'),
which prevents Emacs' CC-mode from munging them.  Besides this, a bang
('!') at the beginning of a line causes the line, minus the bang, to be
written verbatim to the output file (useful for comments).  As a third
special case, any line that begins with the exact characters '/*
*INDENT' is ignored and not written to the output.  This allows '.q'
files to be processed through 'indent' without being munged.

   The syntax of the grammar rules themselves is given in the following
sections.

   The supporting code is passed into the output file largely unchanged.
However, the following escapes are supported.  Each escape must appear
on a line by itself.

'/* (header) */'

     Expands to a series of C '#include' directives which include the
     headers that are required for the parser generated by 'q2c'.

'/* (decls SCOPE) */'

     Expands to C variable and data type declarations for the variables
     and 'enum's input and output by the 'q2c' parser.  SCOPE must be
     either 'local' or 'global'.  'local' causes the declarations to be
     output as function locals.  'global' causes them to be declared as
     'static' module variables; thus, 'global' is a bit of a misnomer.

'/* (parser) */'

     Expands to the entire parser.  Must be enclosed within a C
     function.

'/* (free) */'

     Expands to a set of calls to the 'free' function for variables
     declared by the parser.  Only needs to be invoked if subcommands of
     type 'string' are used in the grammar rules.


File: pspp-dev.info,  Node: Grammar Rules,  Prev: q2c Input Structure,  Up: q2c Input Format

F.3 Grammar Rules
=================

The grammar rules describe the format of the syntax that the parser
generated by 'q2c' will understand.  The way that the grammar rules are
included in 'q2c' input file are described above.

   The grammar rules are divided into tokens of the following types:

Identifier ('ID')

     An identifier token is a sequence of letters, digits, and
     underscores ('_').  Identifiers are _not_ case-sensitive.

String ('STRING')

     String tokens are initiated by a double-quote character ('"') and
     consist of all the characters between that double quote and the
     next double quote, which must be on the same line as the first.
     Within a string, a backslash can be used as a "literal escape".
     The only reasons to use a literal escape are to include a double
     quote or a backslash within a string.

Special character

     Other characters, other than white space, constitute tokens in
     themselves.

   The syntax of the grammar rules is as follows:

     grammar-rules ::= command-name opt-prefix : subcommands .
     command-name ::= ID
                  ::= STRING
     opt-prefix ::=
                ::= ( ID )
     subcommands ::= subcommand
                 ::= subcommands ; subcommand

   The syntax begins with an ID token that gives the name of the
procedure to be parsed.  For command names that contain multiple words,
a STRING token may be used instead, e.g. '"FILE HANDLE"'.  Optionally,
an ID in parentheses specifies a prefix used for all file-scope
identifiers declared by the emitted code.

   The rest of the syntax consists of subcommands separated by
semicolons (';') and terminated with a full stop ('.').

     subcommand ::= default-opt arity-opt ID sbc-defn
     default-opt ::=
                 ::= *
     arity-opt ::=
               ::= +
               ::= ^
     sbc-defn ::= opt-prefix = specifiers
              ::= [ ID ] = array-sbc
              ::= opt-prefix = sbc-special-form

   A subcommand that begins with an asterisk ('*') is the default
subcommand.  The keyword used for the default subcommand can be omitted
in the PSPP syntax file.

   A plus sign ('+') indicates that a subcommand can appear more than
once.  A caret ('^') indicate that a subcommand must appear exactly
once.  A subcommand marked with neither character may appear once or not
at all, but not more than once.

   The subcommand name appears after the leading option characters.

   There are three forms of subcommands.  The first and most common form
simply gives an equals sign ('=') and a list of specifiers, which can
each be set to a single setting.  The second form declares an array,
which is a set of flags that can be individually turned on by the user.
There are also several special forms that do not take a list of
specifiers.

   Arrays require an additional 'ID' argument.  This is used as a
prefix, prepended to the variable names constructed from the specifiers.
The other forms also allow an optional prefix to be specified.

     array-sbc ::= alternatives
               ::= array-sbc , alternatives
     alternatives ::= ID
                  ::= alternatives | ID

   An array subcommand is a set of Boolean values that can independently
be turned on by the user, listed separated by commas (',').  If an value
has more than one name then these names are separated by pipes ('|').

     specifiers ::= specifier
                ::= specifiers , specifier
     specifier ::= opt-id : settings
     opt-id ::=
            ::= ID

   Ordinary subcommands (other than arrays and special forms) require a
list of specifiers.  Each specifier has an optional name and a list of
settings.  If the name is given then a correspondingly named variable
will be used to store the user's choice of setting.  If no name is given
then there is no way to tell which setting the user picked; in this case
the settings should probably have values attached.

     settings ::= setting
              ::= settings / setting
     setting ::= setting-options ID setting-value
     setting-options ::=
                     ::= *
                     ::= !
                     ::= * !

   Individual settings are separated by forward slashes ('/').  Each
setting can be as little as an 'ID' token, but options and values can
optionally be included.  The '*' option means that, for this setting,
the 'ID' can be omitted.  The '!' option means that this option is the
default for its specifier.

     setting-value ::=
                   ::= ( setting-value-2 )
                   ::= setting-value-2
     setting-value-2 ::= setting-value-options setting-value-type : ID
     setting-value-options ::=
                           ::= *
     setting-value-type ::= N
                        ::= D
                        ::= S

   Settings may have values.  If the value must be enclosed in
parentheses, then enclose the value declaration in parentheses.  Declare
the setting type as 'n', 'd', or 's' for integer, floating-point, or
string type, respectively.  The given 'ID' is used to construct a
variable name.  If option '*' is given, then the value is optional;
otherwise it must be specified whenever the corresponding setting is
specified.

     sbc-special-form ::= VAR
                      ::= VARLIST varlist-options
                      ::= INTEGER opt-list
                      ::= DOUBLE opt-list
                      ::= PINT
                      ::= STRING (the literal word STRING)
                      ::= CUSTOM
     varlist-options ::=
                     ::= ( STRING )
     opt-list ::=
              ::= LIST

   The special forms are of the following types:

'VAR'

     A single variable name.

'VARLIST'

     A list of variables.  If given, the string can be used to provide
     'PV_*' options to the call to 'parse_variables'.

'INTEGER'

     A single integer value.

'INTEGER LIST'

     A list of integers separated by spaces or commas.

'DOUBLE'

     A single floating-point value.

'DOUBLE LIST'

     A list of floating-point values.

'PINT'

     A single positive integer value.

'STRING'

     A string value.

'CUSTOM'

     A custom function is used to parse this subcommand.  The function
     must have prototype 'int custom_NAME (void)'.  It should return 0
     on failure (when it has already issued an appropriate diagnostic),
     1 on success, or 2 if it fails and the calling function should
     issue a syntax error on behalf of the custom handler.

*****************************************

                     Version 1.3, 3 November 2008

     Copyright (C) 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     <http://fsf.org/>

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  0. PREAMBLE

     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
     functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
     assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
     with or without modifying it, either commercially or
     noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
     author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
     being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

     This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
     license designed for free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.  We
     recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
     instruction or reference.

  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
     that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can
     be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice
     grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration,
     to use that work under the conditions stated herein.  The
     "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member
     of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You accept
     the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way
     requiring permission under copyright law.

     A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section
     of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
     publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
     subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could
     fall directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document
     is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not
     explain any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of
     historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or
     of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
     regarding them.

     The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the
     notice that says that the Document is released under this License.
     If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it
     is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may
     contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify
     any Invariant Sections then there are none.

     The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
     Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may
     be at most 25 words.

     A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, that is suitable for revising the document
     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed
     of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely
     available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text
     formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats
     suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise
     Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has
     been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by
     readers is not Transparent.  An image format is not Transparent if
     used for any substantial amount of text.  A copy that is not
     "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming
     simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.
     Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.
     Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and
     edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which
     the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and
     the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
     processors for output purposes only.

     The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title
     Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     The "publisher" means any person or entity that distributes copies
     of the Document to the public.

     A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document
     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
     following text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ
     stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
     "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)
     To "Preserve the Title" of such a section when you modify the
     Document means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ" according
     to this definition.

     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
     this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
     implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and
     has no effect on the meaning of this License.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the
     conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and
     the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the title
     equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material on the
     covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the covers, as
     long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these
     conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable
     Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with
     each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general
     network-using public has access to download using public-standard
     network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free
     of added material.  If you use the latter option, you must take
     reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque
     copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will
     remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one
     year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or
     through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies,
     to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
     Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the
     Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing
     distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever
     possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these things in
     the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous
          versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the
          History section of the Document).  You may use the same title
          as a previous version if the original publisher of that
          version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you
          from this requirement.

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
          the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title,
          and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the
          Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled "History" in the
          Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and
          publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add
          an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the
          previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in the
          "History" section.  You may omit a network location for a work
          that was published at least four years before the Document
          itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers
          to gives permission.

       K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
          Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section
          all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered
          in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers or the
          equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

       M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
          "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with any Invariant
          Section.

       O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate
     some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their
     titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's
     license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any other
     section titles.

     You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text
     has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
     definition of a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of
     the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage
     of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
     through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document
     already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added
     by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on
     behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old
     one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added
     the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all
     of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
     their Warranty Disclaimers.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
     "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
     Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled
     "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You
     must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements."

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents
     in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
     License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
     document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a
     storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the
     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
     legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual
     works permit.  When the Document is included in an aggregate, this
     License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which
     are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
     of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed
     on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
     electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
     form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket
     the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
     Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
     include the original English version of this License and the
     original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original version of
     this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
     prevail.

     If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
     "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to
     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the
     actual title.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void,
     and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

     However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
     license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
     provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
     finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the
     copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

     Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
     reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
     violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
     received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from
     that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days
     after your receipt of the notice.

     Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate
     the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you
     under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not
     permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the
     same material does not give you any rights to use it.

  10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     <http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/>.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the
     Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may
     choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free
     Software Foundation.  If the Document specifies that a proxy can
     decide which future versions of this License can be used, that
     proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
     authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.

  11. RELICENSING

     "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site" (or "MMC Site") means any
     World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
     provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
     public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.
     A "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration" (or "MMC") contained in the
     site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
     site.

     "CC-BY-SA" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
     license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
     corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
     California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
     published by that same organization.

     "Incorporate" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
     in part, as part of another Document.

     An MMC is "eligible for relicensing" if it is licensed under this
     License, and if all works that were first published under this
     License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently
     incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover
     texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior
     to November 1, 2008.

     The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the
     site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1,
     2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.

ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
====================================================

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.

   If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
Texts, replace the "with...Texts."  line with this:

         with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being LIST.

   If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free
software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit
their use in free software.
